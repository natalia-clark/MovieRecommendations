The first page reads:                                                               In these days of wars and rumors of                          wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a                          place where there was peace and security,                          where living was not a struggle but                          a lasting delight?

Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes                          the Fountain of Youth - sometimes merely                          \"that little chicken farm.\"                                                               The third page reads:                                                              One man had such a dream and saw it                          come true. He was Robert Conway - England's                          \"Man of the East\" - soldier, diplomat,                          public heroó                                                               The fourth page reads:                                                              Our story starts in the war-torn Chinese                          city of Baskul, where Robert Conway                          has been sent to evacuate ninety white                          people before they are butchered in                          a local revolution.

LONG SHOT                                                              The field is aflare with floodlights                          - on one side is an office building                          - on the other are hangars. The whole                          field is filled with Chinese refugees                          running around wildly. An Army transport                          is in front of the office building,                          motors going.                                                               2.

Over the shot                          we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire.                          In the f.g., we see the silhouetted                          figures of Chinese running away from                          Baskul and toward the Camera, their                          personal packs on their backs.                                                               3.

Conway comes                          out of the building, followed by a small                          group of white people with frightened                          faces. They have to fight their way                          through a horde of milling Chinese.                                                                                        4. MEDIUM SHOT                                                              As Conway and group finally reach the                          plane where Conway forces the white                          people in. In this he is aided by his                          brother, George, a young and vigorous                          Englishman. The pilot sticks his head                          out of the cockpit.                                                               ? 472 ?

Conway pulls a passenger out and gives                          the pilot a signal to start.

Conway and George rush back                          into the office building.                                                               INT.

They                          all lift their panicky faces to Conway                          and George as they enter. A barrage                          of questions are flung at them.

George moves quickly, puts                          out his left hand, wards off the blow                          and with his right he punches the Chinese,                          who reels out of the scene.

He looks off - and what                          he sees startles him.

Several trucks                          loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms                          - come tearing up the road - come to                          a stop. Some fire toward plane - others                          are setting up machine guns.

Conway                          slams the door shut - looks off - then                          cries:                                                               CONWAY                                                              Get down on the floor, everybody.

Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent                          to Shanghai just to take you back to                          England. You know what it means.                                                               (hands him cup)                                                              Here you are. Don't bother about those                          cables now. I want you to drink with                          me.

Conway watches him, amused. George gulps                          down his drink.

Give me the bottle.                                                                                        Conway takes the bottle from him and                          pours himself a second drink.                                                               GEORGE                                                              That's why they're sending for you,                          Bob. With all these foreign entanglements,                          it was bound to happen. They need you.                                                                                        Conway, with a poured drink in hand,                          laughs.                                                               GEORGE                                                              All right, you can laugh if you want                          to. But who else can they get? Who else                          is there in all of England half the                          fighter, half the diplomat, who                                                               ? 482 ?                                                              has half your knowledge of the foreign                          situation? They can't stop you now,                          Bob.                                                               Conway moodily pours himself a third.                          He downs the drink as we                                                               DISSOLVE TO:                                                              INT.

CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY                                                              We find Conway, asleep in his seat,                          his head on his hands. George approaches                          and tenderly spreads a jacket over his                          shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.                                                                                        CONWAY                                                              (drunkenly)                                                              Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report                          out yet?                                                               GEORGE                                                              Yes, Bob.                                                              CONWAY                                                              Did you say we saved ninety white people?                                                                                        GEORGE                                                              Yes.                                                              CONWAY                                                              Hurray for us. Did you say that we left                          ten thousand natives down there to be                          annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that.                          They don't count.                                                               GEORGE                                                              You'd better try to get some sleep,                          Bob.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary.                          Can't you just see me, Freshie, with                          all those other shrewd, little Foreign                          Secretaries?                                                               (confidentially - screws up face)                                                              You see, the trick is to see who can                          out-talk the other. Everybody wants                          something for nothing, and if you can't                          get it with smooth talk, you send an                          army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie.                          I'm not going to have an army. I'm going                          to disband mine. I'm going to sink my                          battleships - I'm going to destroy every                          piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy                          approaches we'll say, \"Come in, gentlemen                          - what can we do for you?\" So then the                          poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.                          And what will they think, Freshie? They'll                          think to themselves - \"Something's wrong                          here. We've been duped. This is not                          according to form. These people seem                          to be quite friendly, and why should                          we shoot them?\" Then they'll lay down                          their arms. You see how simple the whole                          thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked                          right in the pantsó                                                               (pause - drily)                                                              óand I'll be slapped straight into the                          nearest insane asylum.                                                               He starts to pour himself another drink.                                                                                        ? 483 ?                                                              GEORGE                                                              You'd better not drink any more, Bob.                          You're not talking sense.                                                               Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles                          cynically.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Don't worry, George. Nothing's going                          to happen. I'll fall right into line.                          I'll be the good little boy that everybody                          wants me to be. I'll be the best little                          Foreign Secretary we ever had, just                          because I haven't the nerve to be anything                          else.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Do try to sleep, Bob.                                                              CONWAY                                                              Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing,                          sleep.                                                               He grunts and squirms. George tucks                          him in.

It's beautiful.                                                                                        He gets settled. George relaxes and,                          leaning back, shuts his eyes.                                                               40.

CAMERA                          MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches                          the glass panel leading to the cockpit.                          The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner                          we see a strange, Mongolian face - with                          sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays                          across his mouth.                                                               EXT.

We stay on the shot until it vanishes,                          a mere speck, over the horizon.

LONG SHOT                                                              The morning sun peeks over a mountain                          top. From the same direction, as if                          arriving with the sun, the ship looms                          up, and comes roaring toward us.

Then Barnard stirs - opens                          his eyes - and stretches. As he does                          so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

Say, we're supposed to be travelling                          east, aren't we?

When he gets there                          he knocks on the window.

From the cockpit                          side - the small shade suddenly snaps                          up - and George finds himself staring                          into the face of the mysterious pilot.                          He takes an instinctive step backward.                          The pilot turns his head. CAMERA ANGLE                          WIDENS as George keeps backing up until                          he gets to Conway. George turns to Conway                          and shakes his shoulder.

Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens                          his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout                          it, George speaks.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Wake up! Something's happened! It isn't                          Fenner in the cockpit!                                                               Conway looks at him, glances off toward                          the others, and back at George.

This interests Conway and he looks out                          of the window.

Then rising, he crosses to cockpit.                          The others watch him expectantly.                                                                                        46.

Conway                          tries to ask him something in Chinese.                          The pilot glares at them for a second,                          then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively                          they back away.

As Conway turns to open the door, he                          looks off and is startled by something                          he sees. George follows his gaze, and                          a bewildered expression comes into his                          eyes, too.

The strange-looking                          natives have surrounded the plane and                          are closing in.

But from that direction too, a horde                          of natives dash toward them. Conway                          hesitates a second, and like a flash                          springs for the door. But he stops again,                          as he opens the door.

Conway finds                          himself staring into the threatening                          mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly                          shuts the door.

The ship hits and bounces several                          times and finally stops. Its nose seems                          to bury itself in the ground. The people                          are lifted high into the air where they                          remain, suspended for a few seconds,                          terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by                          grinding, crackling sounds, the ship                          flops back and falls on its side. For                          a moment there is stark silence - while                          the people do not stir. A look of relief                          spreads over their faces.

A swirling                          mass of snow greets them, so that they                          have to force their way out.

George quickly runs around to the other                          side. Conway crosses to the cockpit,                          and clambers aboard.                                                               90.

Conway holds the map under the dashboard                          light. He studies it painstakingly,                          and his tense expression changes to                          one of deep concern. George's eyes are                          glued on him.

Right on the border of                          Tibet. Here's where civilization ends.                          We must be a thousand miles beyond it                          - just a blank on the map.

George stares at him, wide-eyed, the                          gravity of their situation slowly penetrating                          his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts                          are interrupted by a knock on the panel,                          and he looks up.                                                               92. MED.

We hear their voices inquiring                          - \"Hey, Conway, what's happening?\" -                          \"What's up?\" - \"Where are we?\" - \"What'd                          you find out?\"                                                               93.

It's slow                          starvation - that's what it is. It's                          a slow, horrible death!                                                               When the significance of this outburst                          finally sinks into the chaotic minds                          of his listeners, they turn to Conway                          hopefully, certain he will refute it.                          But Conway looks beyond them at George.                          From his noncommittal silence, they                          realize that George's statement is the                          truth. They slip into their seats. The                          place is heavy with a fatalistic silence.                          George slowly crosses to his seat near                          Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes.                          Suddenly the air is rent with harsh,                          bitter laughter from Gloria.

The only sound that                          comes in on the tragic quiet is the                          low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling                          of doom has descended upon the five                          people.

The                          snowstorm, treacherous in its fury,                          seems to threaten the valley with complete                          obliteration.                                                               102.

CAMERA                          PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering                          in their blankets as they pace worriedly.

Lovett                          turns from the window.

Heroes of the newspapers!                                                               BARNARD                                                              All right, all right.

Lovett sees something through the window.                                                                                        ? 499 ?

The others quickly glance up, just as                          Conway and George clamber aboard. Conway                          has a serious mien, but George is full                          of vigor and enthusiasm.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Hello, everybody.                                                              He holds out his hat which he has been                          carrying, bottom side up.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Well, we found some food.                                                              Barnard and Lovett rush to him.                                                              GEORGE                                                              No chance of our starving now.                                                              When they see the contents of his hat,                          their faces fall.                                                               LOVETT                                                              What is it?                                                              GEORGE                                                              Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here,                          have some. I've read of people lasting                          thirty days on this stuff.                                                               They grab handfuls. He goes on:                                                              GEORGE                                                              Listen, my brother and I have worked                          out a plan. If we use our heads, we                          should be able to keep alive for weeks,                          until he gets back.                                                               LOVETT & BARNARD                                                              Gets back? Where's he going?                                                              GEORGE                                                              He doesn't know. But he's starting out                          right away in the direction of India.                          Sooner or later he's bound to run into                          somebody - a tribe or something.

Out of the baggage hold he has brought                          some blankets and rope and has been                          wrapping his feet in them. As George                          speaks, he looks up and smiles.                                                               ? 500 ?                                                              GEORGE                                                              Now here's the idea. We found a cave                          over by that small hill. After we bury                          the pilot, we're moving in. We can have                          a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised                          to see Bob back within a week.                                                               Conway's smile dies on his face. We                          get a feeling he is attempting a futile                          journey, and is fully aware of it. He                          resumes the roping of his feet - his                          movements mechanical.                                                               107. MED.

In the distance, just                          appearing over the top of a hill, we                          see a caravan of natives approaching.                          They are not close enough to distinguish                          who or what they are, but that they                          are human beings is apparent.

It comprises                          some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins,                          fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the                          middle of the single file is Chang,                          an elderly Chinese.

He approaches Chang                          and bowing courteously, greets him in                          Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly                          and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill                          has lessened.

A sight that is both magnificent and                          incredible. The eye-filling horizon                          before them throws out a softness and                          a warmth that is breathless. On the                          left is a group of colored pavilions                          that seem as if suspended on the mountainside.                          Down below, in the hazy distance, is                          a valley which gives one the impression                          of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending                          of soft colors. In every direction,                          wherever one might gaze, there is a                          feast of strange and heavenly beauty.                                                                                        126.

Chang smiles                          as he watches their astonished faces.                          Conway turns from the rare magnificence                          of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind                          and storm they had just encountered,                          and looks backward, in the direction                          from which they came to assure himself                          he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang,                          watching him, answers him before he                          can express his astonishment.

The motif                          is neither Oriental nor religious -                          but rather a delicately appointed room,                          subdued in tones.

Barnard emerges from a room across the                          hall, and Lovett beckons to him.

The moon sends                          a stream of light through the windows.                          Outside we see the outline of towering                          mountains. Spread across the bed - her                          clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria                          - her face sunk deep in the pillows.                                                                                        141.

Her cheeks                          are wet - her hair disheveled - her                          eyes bloodshot. We get an impression                          of someone who has suffered for hours.                          Finally, her coughing begins again -                          and unable to stand it, she rises and                          paces the floor - then she crosses to                          the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING                          WITH HER - and into her eyes has come                          a grim, determined expression.                                                               142.

CONWAY                                                              And the wine - excellent.                                                              CHANG                                                              I'm glad you like it. It's made right                          here in the valley.                                                               LOVETT                                                              Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse                          us, we're very anxious to discuss ways                          and means of getting back home.                                                               GEORGE                                                              The first thing we want to do is to                          cable the Foreign Office. All of England                          is waiting to hear about my brother.                          There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready                          to take him back.                                                               CHANG                                                              Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm                          afraid I can't help. Unfortunately,                          we have no wireless here. As a matter                          of fact, we have no means of communication                          with the outside world.                                                               George stares at him suspiciously -                          and then turns to Conway for his reaction                          - but Conway is apparently disinterested                          in the whole conversation.                                                               BARNARD                                                              Not even a radio?                                                              CHANG                                                              It's always been a source of deep regret,                          but the mountains surrounding us have                          made reception almost impossible.                                                                                        ? 509 ?                                                              GEORGE                                                              In that event, we better make arrangements                          to get some porters immediately. Some                          means to get us back to civilization.

GEORGE                                                              As far away as I ever want to be.                                                              CHANG                                                              Oh, dear.                                                              LOVETT                                                              Of course, the porters will be very                          well paid - that is, within reason.

You see,                          we have no porters here.

They                          never venture beyond the point where                          you were met this morning. It is much                          too hazardous.                                                               148.

INSERT: What has been occupying Conway's                          interest. It is a picture of Chang which                          he has been listlessly drawing.

Who                          brought it in?                                                               149.

That                          is our only contact with the outside                          world. Every now and again, depending                          upon favorable weather of course, they                          make the journey.

George                          starts to say something, but the words                          choke in his throat.

I do hope you all sleep                          well. Good night.                                                               The servants move his chair back. Before                          he goes, however, he turns to Conway.

Conway, a little surprised at the distinction                          in his behalf, nods.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Good night, sir.                                                              Chang exits. There is a hushed silence                          following Chang's departure.

He's                          too vague.

We were in a bad mess this morning.

Why                          not make ourselves comfortable until                          the porters do arrive?                                                               While he was speaking, the muted strains                          of a violin float into the room. Conway                          rises.                                                               ? 511 ?                                                              150.

Bob, you don't seem concerned                          at all.

What makes                          a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness,                          envy, the desire to possess something                          owned by another. There can be no crime                          where there is a sufficiency of everything.

Conway scarcely hears                          the last speech, for his attention has                          been caught by the playing of a piano.                          He stops to listen.

It is a spacious, high-ceilinged                          room, oddly shaped, and except for a                          piano, a harp and several chairs, is                          otherwise sparsely furnished. At the                          extreme end, the room is set off by                          an alcove of stained glass extending                          from the ceiling to the floor, where                          it finishes with a deep window seat.                          At the piano we see an old man - and                          by his side is the girl Conway saw last                          night.

He is responsible for everything you                          see here. He built Shangri-La, taught                          our natives, and began our collection                          of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father                          Perrault.                                                               CONWAY                                                              When was all this?                                                              CHANG                                                              Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I                          think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled                          into the Valley, half frozen to death.                          It was typical of the man that, one                          leg being frozen, and of course there                          being no doctors here, he amputated                          the leg himself.                                                               CONWAY                                                              (shocked)                                                              He amputated his own leg?                                                              ? 519 ?                                                              CHANG                                                              Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had                          learned to understand their language,                          the natives told him he could have saved                          his leg. It would have healed without                          amputation.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Well, they didn't actually mean that.                                                                                        CHANG                                                              Yes, yes. They were very sincere about                          it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect                          health is the rule here. They've never                          known anything different. So what was                          true for them they thought would naturally                          be true for anyone else living here.

And particularly                          so in the case of Father Perrault himself.                          Do you know when he and the natives                          were finished building Shangri-La, he                          was 108 years old and still very active,                          in spite of only having one leg?

I should have told you it                          is quite common here to live to a very                          ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain                          water, you might say. But we like to                          believe it is the absence of struggle                          in the way we live. In your countries,                          on the other hand, how often do you                          hear the expression, \"He worried himself                          to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed                          him?\"                                                               CONWAY                                                              Very often.

Your lives are therefore,                          as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural                          death as by indirect suicide.

Suddenly, Conway is startled by the                          sound of hoof-beats and, looking up,                          is in time to see 'the girl' of the                          previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him                          on a horse - screaming delightedly.                          As she passes him, she waves.

As we stay on the                          shot - Conway rides through in exciting                          pursuit.                                                               184.

Conway dashes up,                          but she is lost from sight. He wheels                          around several times - and unable to                          find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving                          up, he starts slowly back. After a few                          moments he is startled by her laughter,                          and glances around.                                                               ? 522 ?                                                              185.

Then                          she swings her horse around and disappears.                                                                                        186.

She hurries to dive back into                          the water and swim to the other side.                          She comes up, spots Conway and watches                          him from hiding, behind some bushes.                                                                                        192.

As a crowning                          touch, he adds a flower to the effigy,                          his eyes twinkling at his little joke.                          With one final glance over his shoulder,                          he turns to leave.                                                               193.

The sharpness of his voice startles                          the others.                                                               GEORGE                                                              What makes you think we're ever going                          to get back? You may not know it, but                          you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately                          kidnapped and brought here - and nobody                          knows whyó                                                               He rises to his feet.                                                              GEORGE                                                              Well, I'm not content to be a prisoner.                          I'm going to find out when we're going                          to get out of this place.

Suddenly he sees a native servant and                          his eyes pop insanely. CAMERA PANS WITH                          HIM as he strides across to the servant                          and grabs him by the shirt-front.

Conway has caught up with him and wrestles                          him away from the servant, who stumbles                          off in fright.

George pushes Conway away from him and                          starts down the corridor.

George                          levels his revolver and sends a stream                          of bullets after the fleeing servant,                          who miraculously manages to skate around                          a corner, unharmed. Conway runs into                          scene, reaching George, and with a quick                          flip of his left hand he smacks him                          over his revolver arm - and with his                          right, he punches him flush on the jaw.

Conway pockets the gun and, bending                          over George, a pained expression on                          his face, starts to lift him.

He drapes him across his                          bed. Conway stands by his side, looking                          down at him, deeply concerned. After                          a moment, Conway shakes him and George                          awakens with a start.

Barnard                          wanders over to Conway, who appears                          lost in thought.

He bows courteously                          to the others, who stand in front of                          George's bed. Conway shuts the door                          and turns the key. He crosses to a door                          leading to another room - and locks                          this one, also. Chang watches him curiously.                          The others, including George, who is                          now alert, are puzzled and somewhat                          impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang.

Chang sits, his placidity unchanged.                          Conway pulls up a chair in front of                          him.

Conway is                          grim.

Chang remains                          without.

As his eyes become                          adjusted to the darkness, he begins                          to sense the architecture and furnishings                          of the room. But as yet no sign of life.                          SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained                          and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather                          simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries                          drape the back walls.

In the gloom only the outlines of his                          pale and wrinkled face can be seen.                          It yields an effect of a fading antique                          portrait.                                                               215.

They are determined                          to leave as soon asó                                                               While he has been speaking, his eyes                          have been gradually taking in the details                          of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS                          HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against                          the man's throne - then, looking down,                          to his legs, one of which appears to                          have been amputated.                                                               218.

Conway evinces surprise.                                                              HIGH LAMA                                                              Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder                          and public hero. I wanted to meet the                          Conway who in one of his books, said,                          \"There are moments in every man's life                          when he glimpses the eternal.\"                                                               The quotation captures Conway's interest                          - and his eyes widen.                                                               HIGH LAMA                                                              That Conway seemed to belong here. In                          fact, it was suggested that someone                          be sent to bring him here.                                                               CONWAY                                                              That I be brought here? Who had that                          brilliant idea?                                                               HIGH LAMA                                                              Sondra Bizet.

HIGH LAMA                                                              Yes. She has read your books and has                          a profound admiration for you, as have                          we all.                                                               ? 532 ?                                                              CONWAY                                                              Of course I have suspected that our                          being here is no accident. Furthermore,                          I have a feeling that we're never supposed                          to leave. But that, for the moment,                          doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet                          that when it comes. What particularly                          interests me at present is, why was                          I brought here? What possible use can                          I be to an already thriving community?                                                                                        HIGH LAMA                                                              We need men like you here, to be sure                          that our community will continue to                          thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La                          has much to give you. You are still,                          by the world's standards, a youngish                          man. Yet in the normal course of existence,                          you can expect twenty or thirty years                          of gradually diminishing activity. Here,                          however, in Shangri-La, by our standards                          your life has just begun, and may go                          on and on.                                                               CONWAY                                                              But to be candid, Father, a prolonged                          future doesn't excite me. It would have                          to have a point. I've sometimes doubted                          whether life itself has any. And if                          that is so, then long life must be even                          more pointless. No, I'd need a much                          more definite reason for going on and                          on.                                                               HIGH LAMA                                                              We have reason. It is the entire meaning                          and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to                          me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw                          all the nations strengthening, not in                          wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and                          the will to destroy. I saw their machine                          power multiply until a single weaponed                          man might match a whole army. I foresaw                          a time when man, exulting in the technique                          of murder, would rage so hotly over                          the world that every book, every treasure,                          would be doomed to destruction. This                          vision was so vivid and so moving that                          I determined to gather together all                          the things of beauty and culture that                          I could and preserve them here against                          the doom toward which the world is rushing.                                                                                        (pause)                                                              Look at the world today! Is there anything                          more pitiful? What madness there is,                          what blindness, what unintelligent leadership!                          A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity                          crashing headlong against each other,                          propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.                          The time must come, my friend, when                          this orgy will spend itself, when brutality                          and the lust for power must perish by                          its own sword. Against that time is                          why I avoided death and am here, and                          why you were brought here. For when                          that day comes, the world must begin                          to look for a new life. And it is our                          hope that they may find it here. For                          here we shall be with their books                                                                                        ? 533 ?                                                              and their music and a way of life based                          on one simple rule: Be Kind.                                                               (pause)                                                              When that day comes, it is our hope                          that the brotherly love of Shangri-La                          will spread throughout the world.

A long silence ensues during which Conway,                          so engrossed is he in all he has just                          heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who                          has risen slowly and now stands before                          him. The Lama reaches down and gently                          touches him on the shoulder.

Conway kisses the High Lama's hand.

Conway slowly rises to his feet and                          turns to leave scene.                                                               INT.

Lovett emerges from one of the                          rooms and sees him. He beckons to those                          inside and almost immediately they come                          out and start toward Conway.                                                               222.

He comes to a spot                          where a man and a woman are tilling                          the soil, and stops to watch them. The                          man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes                          a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway                          also bows. The woman curtsies prettily                          and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in                          acknowledgement.                                                               He is in a cheerful frame of mind and                          continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING                          WITH HIM. He greets several other people.                          Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff                          their hats. Conway does likewise.                                                                                        EXT.

FULL SHOT                                                              Conway is walking along a street in                          the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare,                          unlike anything we have ever seen before.                          The small, one-story huts along its                          very narrow sidewalk are of singularly                          varied architecture - giving the impression                          of being \"homemade.\" As a result of                          this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic                          about them is similar - their cleanliness.                          Something about the atmosphere is fresh                          and wholesome and peaceful. In front                          of several of the huts native women                          sit - some weaving on a tapestry board,                          some nursing babies, some asleep, and                          some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.                                                                                        228. MED. TRUCKING SHOT                                                              With Conway, walking along. As he passes,                          the women smile at him in the most friendly                          fashion. From inside these homes, soft                          and soothing music emanates. At the                          end of the street, Conway finally arrives                          at a garden spot. The suddenness of                          this is startling, too - because of                          its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway                          throws himself at the foot of an overhanging                          tree, and leans against the trunk.                                                                                        ? 535 ?                                                              229.

He remains this way quietly for a few                          seconds, when he is attracted by the                          singing of a chorus of children's voices.                          He glances around.                                                               230. LONG SHOT                                                              From Conway's angle. In the shadow of                          a row of overhanging trees which form                          an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty                          children sing a hymn, or nursery song                          - in English. Sondra (the violin girl                          of previous scenes) stands in front                          of them, a baton in hand, conducting                          them.                                                               231.

He finds himself a comfortable place                          under a tree and sits down. The children,                          still singing, have seen his approach                          and crane their necks curiously.                                                               233.

Then she notices they are                          being distracted and casually turns                          her head. She is somewhat startled at                          seeing Conway, but quickly recovers                          her composure, and smiles wanly.                                                               234.

Sondra, murmuring, \"Of course, dear\"                          and still waving her baton is, for the                          moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning                          to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

He turns                          his head to watch Sondra, and when he                          looks forward again, finds himself off-beat.                          To cover his embarrassment, he smiles                          foolishly.                                                               241. MED.

The children                          break into laughter.                                                               242. MED.

The pigeons flutter around,                          landing on Sondra and Conway, as she                          shows him her collection with pride.

My father and mother were in a                          party of explorers who got lost and                          wandered around for a year. When Chang                          found us, only Father and I were alive.                          But he was too weak to climb the pass.                          He died on the way. I was brought up                          here by Father Perrault himself.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked                          to him last night.

She is greatly amused.

Am                          I so strange?

I have                          the same idea about Shangri-La. The                          sense that I've been here before, that                          I belong here.

The very air that                          I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet                          rooted in the good earth of this fertile                          valley, while its head explores the                          eternal. All the beautiful things I                          see, these cherry blossoms, you - all                          somehow familiar.

A crime, a great crime,                          yet I accept it amiably, with the same                          warm amiability one tolerates only from                          a very dear and close friend.

Just as I'm sure there's                          a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's                          heart. I have never seen the outside                          world. But I understand there are millions                          and millions of people who are supposed                          to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know                          that secretly they are all hoping to                          find a garden spot where there is peace                          and security, where there's beauty and                          comfort, where they wouldn't have to                          be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish                          the whole world might come to this valley.

Because it isn't lady-like to do that.                          Why? Because that's what forks are made                          for, darling.

That silly shadow racing                          along over mountains and valleys, covering                          ten times the distance of the plane.                          It was always there to greet us with                          outstretched arms when we landed. And                          I've been thinking that somehow you're                          that plane, and I'm that silly shadow.                          That all my life I've been rushing up                          and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing                          over obstacles, never dreaming that                          one day that beautiful thing in flight                          would land on this earth and into my                          arms.                                                               ? 547 ?

Apparently it's worked with                          some people. Perhaps it's because they                          lack the courage to do anything about                          it. But not me, Chang. You're up against                          the wrong man. I'll get out of here,                          if I have to blow this fantastic place                          into the valley! I'll get outóporters                          or no porters!

I have                          looked into their eyes and heard their                          voices - always in hope that I might                          find you . My friend, it is not an arduous                          task that I bequeath, for our order                          knows only silken bonds.

And                          they will all be here, my son, hidden                          behind the mountains in the Valley of                          the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a                          miracle.                                                               The voice of the Lama, toward the last,                          seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly                          engrossed, half-consciously waits for                          it to continue. Following a protracted                          silence, he slowly turns toward the                          Lama. A breeze blows through the room,                          ruffling curtains on the window.                                                               277.

Quite unaware that he                          is being moved emotionally, tears well                          up in his eyes. While still sitting                          this way, unable to stir, he becomes                          conscious of activity around him.                                                                                        279.

Then, in intervals of seconds,                          groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter                          softly and silently, and gather around                          the High Lama.

CLOSE SHOT                                                              Conway stands in front of a window -                          his arms extended across - peering out                          moodily. He is watching a solemn and                          slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers                          - the funeral rites of the High Lama                          - accompanied by cermonial music and                          drum-beating.                                                               284. LONG SHOT                                                              Shooting over his shoulder.                                                              Getting his view of the magisterial                          procession.                                                               285. CLOSE SHOT                                                              Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the                          surroundings of which he has just become                          master.                                                               286. CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR                                                              George appears in the doorway. He looks                          around and espies Conway. For a moment                          he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.                                                                                        GEORGE                                                              (softly)                                                              Bobó                                                              287. MEDIUM SHOT                                                              As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces                          no emotion whatsoever.                                                               CONWAY                                                              (a murmur)                                                              Hello, George.                                                              George looks at him peculiarly. Conway's                          behavior is odd in view of their strained                          relationship.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Well, you can stop worrying about everything                          now, Bob. I've made arrangements to                          leave. If you'll let me close that window,                          I can talk to you. That noise is driving                          me crazy.                                                               He closes the window.                                                              GEORGE                                                              I said we're getting out of here. Back                          to civilization. I made a deal with                          the porters. They brought in a load                          of books or something, and they're leaving                          tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for                          us five miles outside the valley. Come                          on, get your things together. Where's                          your top coat?                                                               288. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO                                                              CONWAY                                                              You can't leave, George.                                                              ? 557 ?                                                              GEORGE                                                              Why not? What's going to stop me?                                                              CONWAY                                                              (pleading)                                                              You mustn't. You've got to stay here                          now.                                                               GEORGE                                                              (sharply)                                                              Stay here?!                                                              (more softly)                                                              What's the matter with you, Bob? You've                          been acting strangely ever since we                          came here.                                                               (no response from Conway)                                                              I've never seen you like this. Why can't                          we leave? What's stopping us?                                                               Conway combats an impulse to tell him                          the whole story.                                                               CONWAY                                                              (impulsively)                                                              Something grand and beautiful, George.                          Something I've been searching for all                          my life. The answer to the confusion                          and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've                          found it, George, and I can't leave                          it. You mustn't either.                                                               GEORGE                                                              I don't know what you're talking about.                          You're carrying around a secret that                          seems to be eating you up. If you'll                          only tell me about it.                                                               CONWAY                                                              I will, George. I want to tell you.                          I'll burst with it if I don't. It's                          weird and fantastical and sometimes                          unbelievable, but so beautiful!                                                               (pause)                                                              Well, as you know, we were kidnapped                          and brought here . . .                                                               While he is speaking, we slowly                                                              DISSOLVE TO:                                                              289. SAME SCENE:                                                              As Conway is concluding his story.                                                                                        CONWAY                                                               . . . And that's the whole story, George.                          He died as peacefully as the passing                          of a cloud's shadow. His last words                          to me were, \"I place in your hands,                          my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.\"                          Now you know why I can't leave.                                                               George listens to him intently, his                          face a mask of apprehension. He stares                          at his brother for some time and finally                          rises and walks around for a few moments.                                                                                        GEORGE                                                              (running his hand through his hair)                                                                                        Well, I - I really don't know what to                          say. Except that you must be completely                          mad.                                                               ? 558 ?                                                              CONWAY                                                              So you think I'm mad?                                                              GEORGE                                                              What else can I think after a tale like                          that? Good heavens, Bob, things like                          that don't happen today. We're living                          in the twentieth century.                                                               CONWAY                                                              So you think it's all nonsense, huh?                                                                                        290. MED. SHOT - THE TWO                                                              GEORGE                                                              I think you've been hypnotized by a                          lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why,                          I wouldn't believe it if I heard it                          in an English monastery. Why should                          I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you                          know the things they told you are true?                          Did they show you any proof?                                                               CONWAY                                                              I don't need any proof.                                                              GEORGE                                                              (contemptuously)                                                              I knew there was a reason I hated this                          place. I'd give half my life to fly                          over it with a load of bombs just for                          what they've done to you. How do you                          know the things they told you are true?                          Did they show you any proof? All this                          talk about the Lamas being hundreds                          of years old. How do you know? Did you                          see their birth certificates?                                                               (some more pacing)                                                              I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of                          decrepit old men sit around and dream                          about reforming the world. And you,                          Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground                          Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.

It's                          obviously a lot of bunk.

This is                          no place for you.

Do you want                          to stay here until you're half dead?                          Until your mind starts corroding like                          the rest of them?

I don't want to talk                          about it anymore.                                                               ? 559 ?

You said they stole that plane to                          bring you here. I didn't want to come.                          You owe me some responsibility.                                                               CONWAY                                                              I'm tired of owing you things. You're                          free to go. Go ahead.

GEORGE                                                              (cynically)                                                              So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La?                          Nobody would ever think of leaving?

She's pleaded                          with me ever since I came here to take                          her away from this awful place. She's                          cried in my arms for hours, for fear                          I'd leave her behind. And what's more,                          she's made two trips to the plateau                          to bribe the porters - for me!                                                               CONWAY                                                              (doesn't want to believe it)                                                              I don't believe it! I don't believe                          a word of it!                                                               GEORGE                                                              All right. I'll prove it to you! You                          believe everything they've told you                          - without proof! I'll prove my story!                                                                                        As he speaks he has crossed to door                          leading to adjoining room. Conway's                          eyes are glued on him.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Come in a minute.                                                              After a few seconds Maria appears in                          the doorway and stands there timidly.

She steps forward.                                                              293. MED. SHOT - THE THREE                                                              GEORGE                                                              (shrewdly)                                                              I've got some bad news for you, Maria.                          My brother and I have decided we can't                          take you along.                                                               Maria's face collapses.                                                              ? 562 ?

She rushes to George and throws her                          arms around him.                                                               MARIA                                                              But you promised me! You promised to                          take me with you!                                                               Over her shoulder George looks victoriously                          at Conway, who cannot believe his ears.                          Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway.                                                               MARIA                                                              It's all your fault! It was all arranged                          until he spoke to you! Why can't you                          leave us alone?                                                               CONWAY                                                              Do you mean to tell me you want to leave                          Shangri-La?                                                               MARIA                                                              I'll die if I have to stay here another                          minute! I've waited a long time for                          this chance to go, and you're not going                          to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go                          alone. It was I who bribed the porters.                          If it weren't for me, you'd never get                          out!                                                               CONWAY                                                              I thought the porters had instructions                          from the High Lama not to take anyone.                                                                                        MARIA                                                              The High Lama? Who pays any attention                          to him? The porters laugh at the High                          Lama. All they want to know is how much                          gold he will give them. Well, I gave                          them more gold. I've been stealing it                          for a year. I'd do anything to get out                          of this place. To get away from that                          High Lama - the one who calls himself                          Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane                          for years!

You won't see                          me shedding any tears over him!

You don't                          want to look like an old woman, do you?

MARIA                                                              I thought so! He tells everyone I'm                          old. He wants them to stay away from                          me. He can't stand it when anyone comes                          near. He's punished me for every minute                          I've spent with George. If it weren't                          for him, I would have been out of here                          long ago, but he always stops me. Six                          months ago, I tried to escape and he                          locked me in a dark room. I nearly went                          crazy.

Is this the skin of an                          old woman? Look into my eyes and see                          if these are the eyes of an old woman?

I can't believe                          it. She's lying.

He has backed her into a corner and                          is nearly throttling her.

The chances                          are that we'll never come out of that                          horrible trip alive, but I'd rather                          die out there in a snowstorm and be                          buried alive, than to stay here one                          more minute now.                                                               Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits                          a few cynical chuckles - shakes his                          head - stares blankly for a moment.

Suddenly the girl loses                          her bearings - slips - screams - and                          is caught by Conway just in time to                          save her from falling down the side                          of the jagged mountain.

She                          has her head down. They trudge silently.                          The porters are off in the distance,                          leaving them behind.

I can't go on anymore!                          I've got to rest.                                                               She stumbles and they help her up. George                          looks off toward the porters helplessly.

The                          lead porter whips out a gun and fires                          at them for sport.                                                               315. MED.

They are still laughing,                          and now others have drawn out their                          guns. Firing off wildly, they trigger                          an ominous thunder overhead.                                                               317. MED.

Conway and George can only stare, dazed                          and frightened.

George walks behind.                          The wind continues to howl.                                                               ? 568 ?                                                              321.

Suddenly, his eyes                          widen.                                                               322.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK as they                          straighten up. Both stare down aghast                          at the girl, whom we do not see.                                                               325.

We cannot get a clear view of                          her face. But what we see seems to us                          to be small, withered and aged. She                          is dead. The men stare at her intently.                                                                                        327.

Slowly his head turns toward                          the cliff behind him - and his eyes                          become alert with an idea. His face                          lights up with great determination.                          He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks                          away, racing out of scene.

Gentlemen, in the whole                          course of my life, I have never encountered                          anything so grim. During these last                          ten months, that man has done the most                          astounding things. He learned how to                          fly, stole an army plane and got caught,                          put into jail, escaped . . . all in                          an amazingly short space of time. But                          this was only the beginning of his adventures.                                                                                        (leaning forward)                                                              He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing                          forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere                          I went, I heard the most amazing stories                          of the man's adventures. Positively                          astounding. Until eventually, I trailed                          him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.                                                                                        348.

But his                          memory - ah - his memory will live with                          those natives for the rest of their                          lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they                          called him. They'll never forget the                          devil-eyed stranger who six times tried                          to go over a mountain pass where no                          other human being dared to travel, and                          six times was forced back by the severest                          storms. They'll never forget the madman                          who stole their food and clothing -                          whom they locked up in their barracks                          - but who fought six of their guards                          to escape.                                                               349.

He led                          them the wildest chase through their                          own country, and finally he disappeared                          over that very mountain pass that they                          themselves dared not travel.

THE CAMERA PANS UP to the summit of                          the incline - and we see that beyond                          it the horizon is filled with a strange                          warm light. Conway's figure - in silhouette                          - disappears over the hill - bells ring                          - and as the music begins to swell[16]                                                                                        FADE OUT.
