    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will address a RAG problem: How can I get a movie recommendation based on the scripts of the movies?\n",
    "\n",
    "We see many different potential unique value propositions for this in terms of validating movie content based on the literal content rather than the content contained in reviews. While reviews are valuable, there are systems that analyze reviews and give you recommendations for movies based on reviews. Sometimes, you may not have the same tastes as reviewers or you may not agree with human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will apply deep learning models to receive human text explanations of desired movie descriptions to see and recommend movies where their scripts match the themes outlined in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this model will employ **Transfer Learning** using a pretrained model on the English language and then supplied with movie scripts in 2 specific genres of movies: Horror and Drama. In the future, this project could grow to include more movie scripts, but for the scope of this assignment, we focus our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Basic Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Employ a pre-trained English language model: -----. This model is able to understand sentiments and such to classify English text.\n",
    "2. Retrain the model based on our specific style of data, movie script analysis. It will learn the specific nuances of movie script presentations to know where to look. Our dataset consists of: -------\n",
    "3. Create a front-end application on top to provide an interactive experience for the users of the application and script fanatics!\n"

LONG SHOT                                                              The field is aflare with floodlights                          - on one side is an office building                          - on the other are hangars. The whole                          field is filled with Chinese refugees                          running around wildly. An Army transport                          is in front of the office building,                          motors going.                                                               2.

Over the shot                          we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire.                          In the f.g., we see the silhouetted                          figures of Chinese running away from                          Baskul and toward the Camera, their                          personal packs on their backs.                                                               3.

Conway comes                          out of the building, followed by a small                          group of white people with frightened                          faces. They have to fight their way                          through a horde of milling Chinese.                                                                                        4. MEDIUM SHOT                                                              As Conway and group finally reach the                          plane where Conway forces the white                          people in. In this he is aided by his                          brother, George, a young and vigorous                          Englishman. The pilot sticks his head                          out of the cockpit.                                                               ? 472 ?

Conway pulls a passenger out and gives                          the pilot a signal to start.

Conway and George rush back                          into the office building.                                                               INT.

They                          all lift their panicky faces to Conway                          and George as they enter. A barrage                          of questions are flung at them.

Conway is                          writing on a small pad - which he rests                          on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging                          through a closet - rear of the cabin.                                                                                        38. MED.

George                          reaches into the closet and emerges                          with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights                          up.

Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent                          to Shanghai just to take you back to                          England. You know what it means.                                                               (hands him cup)                                                              Here you are.

Conway watches him, amused. George gulps                          down his drink.

Conway takes the bottle from him and                          pours himself a second drink.

With all these foreign entanglements,                          it was bound to happen. They need you.                                                                                        Conway, with a poured drink in hand,                          laughs.                                                               GEORGE                                                              All right, you can laugh if you want                          to. But who else can they get? Who else                          is there in all of England half the                          fighter, half the diplomat, who                                                               ? 482 ?                                                              has half your knowledge of the foreign                          situation? They can\\'t stop you now,                          Bob.                                                               Conway moodily pours himself a third.                          He downs the drink as we                                                               DISSOLVE TO:                                                              INT.

George approaches                          and tenderly spreads a jacket over his                          shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.

Did you make that report                          out yet?                                                               GEORGE                                                              Yes, Bob.

GEORGE                                                              Yes.                                                              CONWAY                                                              Hurray for us. Did you say that we left                          ten thousand natives down there to be                          annihilated? No, you wouldn\\'t say that.                          They don\\'t count.                                                               GEORGE                                                              You\\'d better try to get some sleep,                          Bob.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Just you wait until I\\'m Foreign Secretary.                          Can\\'t you just see me, Freshie, with                          all those other shrewd, little Foreign                          Secretaries?                                                               (confidentially - screws up face)                                                              You see, the trick is to see who can                          out-talk the other. Everybody wants                          something for nothing, and if you can\\'t                          get it with smooth talk, you send an                          army in. I\\'m going to fool them, Freshie.                          I\\'m not going to have an army. I\\'m going                          to disband mine. I\\'m going to sink my                          battleships - I\\'m going to destroy every                          piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy                          approaches we\\'ll say, \"Come in, gentlemen                          - what can we do for you?\" So then the                          poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.                          And what will they think, Freshie? They\\'ll                          think to themselves - \"Something\\'s wrong                          here. We\\'ve been duped. This is not                          according to form. These people seem                          to be quite friendly, and why should                          we shoot them?\" Then they\\'ll lay down                          their arms. You see how simple the whole                          thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked                          right in the pants√≥                                                               (pause - drily)                                                              √≥and I\\'ll be slapped straight into the                          nearest insane asylum.                                                               He starts to pour himself another drink.                                                                                        ? 483 ?                                                              GEORGE                                                              You\\'d better not drink any more, Bob.                          You\\'re not talking sense.                                                               Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles                          cynically.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Don\\'t worry, George. Nothing\\'s going                          to happen. I\\'ll fall right into line.

George relaxes and,                          leaning back, shuts his eyes.                                                               40.

Instead of Fenner                          we see a strange, Mongolian face - with                          sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays                          across his mouth.                                                               EXT.

From the same direction, as if                          arriving with the sun, the ship looms                          up, and comes roaring toward us.

Then Barnard stirs - opens                          his eyes - and stretches. As he does                          so, he sees that Lovett is awake.

When he gets there                          he knocks on the window.

From the cockpit                          side - the small shade suddenly snaps                          up - and George finds himself staring                          into the face of the mysterious pilot.                          He takes an instinctive step backward.                          The pilot turns his head.

George turns to Conway                          and shakes his shoulder.

Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens                          his eyes, yawns and stretches. Throughout                          it, George speaks.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Wake up!

Conway looks at him, glances off toward                          the others, and back at George.

This interests Conway and he looks out                          of the window.

Then rising, he crosses to cockpit.                          The others watch him expectantly.                                                                                        46.

Conway                          tries to ask him something in Chinese.                          The pilot glares at them for a second,                          then a gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively                          they back away.

The ship hits and bounces several                          times and finally stops. Its nose seems                          to bury itself in the ground. The people                          are lifted high into the air where they                          remain, suspended for a few seconds,                          terror-stricken.

George quickly runs around to the other                          side. Conway crosses to the cockpit,                          and clambers aboard.                                                               90.

The utter limpness                          of the pilot\\'s body gives him pause.                          He lifts up his chin, stares into his                          face - pulls up his eyelid and then                          places a hand over his heart. He turns                          slowly toward George, who has been watching                          his brother intently.                                                               ? 496 ?

Conway holds the map under the dashboard                          light. He studies it painstakingly,                          and his tense expression changes to                          one of deep concern. George\\'s eyes are                          glued on him.

It\\'s slow                          starvation - that\\'s what it is. It\\'s                          a slow, horrible death!                                                               When the significance of this outburst                          finally sinks into the chaotic minds                          of his listeners, they turn to Conway                          hopefully, certain he will refute it.                          But Conway looks beyond them at George.                          From his noncommittal silence, they                          realize that George\\'s statement is the                          truth. They slip into their seats. The                          place is heavy with a fatalistic silence.                          George slowly crosses to his seat near                          Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes.                          Suddenly the air is rent with harsh,                          bitter laughter from Gloria. They all                          look up.                                                               ? 498 ?

The only sound that                          comes in on the tragic quiet is the                          low moaning of the wind outside.

The                          snowstorm, treacherous in its fury,                          seems to threaten the valley with complete                          obliteration.                                                               102.

Out of the baggage hold he has brought                          some blankets and rope and has been                          wrapping his feet in them.

In the distance, just                          appearing over the top of a hill, we                          see a caravan of natives approaching.                          They are not close enough to distinguish                          who or what they are, but that they                          are human beings is apparent.

It comprises                          some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins,                          fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the                          middle of the single file is Chang,                          an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward                          as their leader.                                                               114. MED.

He approaches Chang                          and bowing courteously, greets him in                          Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly                          and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English.

She stops                          and has a fit of coughing.                                                               ? 503 ?

They                          have reached quite a height although                          the peak of the mountain they are ascending                          towers high above them. The cutting                          wind moans treacherously as it caroms                          off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops                          them.                                                               123.

They round a curve and                          come upon a narrow crevice which opens                          up into a passageway. One by one they                          step through, assisted by the natives.                          On the other side, they sigh relievedly.                          Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill                          has lessened. They look up to inspect                          their surroundings and a startled look                          comes into their eyes.                                                               124.

A sight that is both magnificent and                          incredible. The eye-filling horizon                          before them throws out a softness and                          a warmth that is breathless. On the                          left is a group of colored pavilions                          that seem as if suspended on the mountainside.                          Down below, in the hazy distance, is                          a valley which gives one the impression                          of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending                          of soft colors. In every direction,                          wherever one might gaze, there is a                          feast of strange and heavenly beauty.                                                                                        126.

Chang smiles                          as he watches their astonished faces.                          Conway turns from the rare magnificence                          of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind                          and storm they had just encountered,                          and looks backward, in the direction                          from which they came to assure himself                          he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang,                          watching him, answers him before he                          can express his astonishment.

The motif                          is neither Oriental nor religious -                          but rather a delicately appointed room,                          subdued in tones.

The moon sends                          a stream of light through the windows.                          Outside we see the outline of towering                          mountains. Spread across the bed - her                          clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria                          - her face sunk deep in the pillows.                                                                                        141.

Her cheeks                          are wet - her hair disheveled - her                          eyes bloodshot. We get an impression                          of someone who has suffered for hours.                          Finally, her coughing begins again -                          and unable to stand it, she rises and                          paces the floor - then she crosses to                          the window and looks down, CAMERA PANNING                          WITH HER - and into her eyes has come                          a grim, determined expression.                                                               142.

It\\'s made right                          here in the valley.

GEORGE                                                              The first thing we want to do is to                          cable the Foreign Office. All of England                          is waiting to hear about my brother.                          There\\'s a cruiser at Shanghai ready                          to take him back.

Unfortunately,                          we have no wireless here. As a matter                          of fact, we have no means of communication                          with the outside world.                                                               George stares at him suspiciously -                          and then turns to Conway for his reaction                          - but Conway is apparently disinterested                          in the whole conversation.

Some                          means to get us back to civilization.

Conway, a little surprised at the distinction                          in his behalf, nods.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Good night, sir.                                                              Chang exits. There is a hushed silence                          following Chang\\'s departure.

He\\'s                          too vague.

CONWAY                                                              It seems to me we should be grateful.                          We were in a bad mess this morning.

Why                          not make ourselves comfortable until                          the porters do arrive?                                                               While he was speaking, the muted strains                          of a violin float into the room. Conway                          rises.                                                               ? 511 ?                                                              150.

I saw some cards                          in the other room.

He disappears onto the balcony. George                          watches him go.

Lovett detests the pet names, but follows.

What makes                          a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness,                          envy, the desire to possess something                          owned by another.

It is a spacious, high-ceilinged                          room, oddly shaped, and except for a                          piano, a harp and several chairs, is                          otherwise sparsely furnished. At the                          extreme end, the room is set off by                          an alcove of stained glass extending                          from the ceiling to the floor, where                          it finishes with a deep window seat.

We do not buy or sell or seek personal                          fortunes because, well, because there                          is no uncertain future here for which                          to accumulate it.                                                               ? 518 ?

CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO                                                              They have arrived in a small room, where                          they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl                          of large nuts, cracks one, and hands                          the nut to Conway. Then he does the                          same for himself. During the following                          scene, both are eating nuts from the                          bowl.

How did you pay for them?

So                          we merely . . .

You know Mr.                          Chang, there\\'s something so simple and                          naive about all of this that I suspect                          there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence                          somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did                          it all start?                                                               CHANG                                                              That, my dear Conway, is the story of                          a remarkable man.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Who?                                                              CHANG                                                              A Belgian priest by the name of Father                          Perrault, the first European to find                          this place, and a very great man indeed.                          He is responsible for everything you                          see here. He built Shangri-La, taught                          our natives, and began our collection                          of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father                          Perrault.                                                               CONWAY                                                              When was all this?                                                              CHANG                                                              Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I                          think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled                          into the Valley, half frozen to death.                          It was typical of the man that, one                          leg being frozen, and of course there                          being no doctors here, he amputated                          the leg himself.                                                               CONWAY                                                              (shocked)                                                              He amputated his own leg?                                                              ? 519 ?                                                              CHANG                                                              Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had                          learned to understand their language,                          the natives told him he could have saved                          his leg. It would have healed without                          amputation.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Well, they didn\\'t actually mean that.                                                                                        CHANG                                                              Yes, yes. They were very sincere about                          it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect                          health is the rule here. They\\'ve never                          known anything different. So what was                          true for them they thought would naturally                          be true for anyone else living here.

And particularly                          so in the case of Father Perrault himself.                          Do you know when he and the natives                          were finished building Shangri-La, he                          was 108 years old and still very active,                          in spite of only having one leg?

Just a little bowled over, that\\'s                          all.

I should have told you it                          is quite common here to live to a very                          ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain                          water, you might say. But we like to                          believe it is the absence of struggle                          in the way we live. In your countries,                          on the other hand, how often do you                          hear the expression, \"He worried himself                          to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed                          him?\"                                                               CONWAY                                                              Very often.

Your lives are therefore,                          as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural                          death as by indirect suicide.

Finally, giving                          up, he starts slowly back.

He looks up alertly.

He bows courteously                          to the others, who stand in front of                          George\\'s bed. Conway shuts the door                          and turns the key. He crosses to a door                          leading to another room - and locks                          this one, also. Chang watches him curiously.                          The others, including George, who is                          now alert, are puzzled and somewhat                          impressed. Then Conway comes to Chang.

Chang sits, his placidity unchanged.                          Conway pulls up a chair in front of                          him.

As his eyes become                          adjusted to the darkness, he begins                          to sense the architecture and furnishings                          of the room. But as yet no sign of life.                          SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a dark-curtained                          and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather                          simply. Very sombre, indistinct tapestries                          drape the back walls.

In the gloom only the outlines of his                          pale and wrinkled face can be seen.                          It yields an effect of a fading antique                          portrait.                                                               215.

But my friends do not care                          for this mystery. They are determined                          to leave as soon as√≥                                                               While he has been speaking, his eyes                          have been gradually taking in the details                          of the old man. The CAMERA QUICKLY FOLLOWS                          HIS GAZE - to crutches leaning against                          the man\\'s throne - then, looking down,                          to his legs, one of which appears to                          have been amputated.                                                               218.

HIGH LAMA                                                              Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder                          and public hero. I wanted to meet the                          Conway who in one of his books, said,                          \"There are moments in every man\\'s life                          when he glimpses the eternal.\"                                                               The quotation captures Conway\\'s interest                          - and his eyes widen.                                                               HIGH LAMA                                                              That Conway seemed to belong here. In                          fact, it was suggested that someone                          be sent to bring him here.                                                               CONWAY                                                              That I be brought here? Who had that                          brilliant idea?

She has read your books and has                          a profound admiration for you, as have                          we all.                                                               ? 532 ?                                                              CONWAY                                                              Of course I have suspected that our                          being here is no accident. Furthermore,                          I have a feeling that we\\'re never supposed                          to leave. But that, for the moment,                          doesn\\'t concern me greatly. I\\'ll meet                          that when it comes. What particularly                          interests me at present is, why was                          I brought here? What possible use can                          I be to an already thriving community?                                                                                        HIGH LAMA                                                              We need men like you here, to be sure                          that our community will continue to                          thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La                          has much to give you. You are still,                          by the world\\'s standards, a youngish                          man. Yet in the normal course of existence,                          you can expect twenty or thirty years                          of gradually diminishing activity. Here,                          however, in Shangri-La, by our standards                          your life has just begun, and may go                          on and on.

It would have                          to have a point. I\\'ve sometimes doubted                          whether life itself has any. And if                          that is so, then long life must be even                          more pointless. No, I\\'d need a much                          more definite reason for going on and                          on.                                                               HIGH LAMA                                                              We have reason. It is the entire meaning                          and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to                          me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw                          all the nations strengthening, not in                          wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and                          the will to destroy. I saw their machine                          power multiply until a single weaponed                          man might match a whole army. I foresaw                          a time when man, exulting in the technique                          of murder, would rage so hotly over                          the world that every book, every treasure,                          would be doomed to destruction. This                          vision was so vivid and so moving that                          I determined to gather together all                          the things of beauty and culture that                          I could and preserve them here against                          the doom toward which the world is rushing.                                                                                        (pause)                                                              Look at the world today! Is there anything                          more pitiful? What madness there is,                          what blindness, what unintelligent leadership!                          A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity                          crashing headlong against each other,                          propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.                          The time must come, my friend, when                          this orgy will spend itself, when brutality                          and the lust for power must perish by                          its own sword. Against that time is                          why I avoided death and am here, and                          why you were brought here. For when                          that day comes, the world must begin                          to look for a new life. And it is our                          hope that they may find it here. For                          here we shall be with their books                                                                                        ? 533 ?                                                              and their music and a way of life based                          on one simple rule: Be Kind.

The Lama reaches down and gently                          touches him on the shoulder.

He comes to a spot                          where a man and a woman are tilling                          the soil, and stops to watch them. The                          man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes                          a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway                          also bows. The woman curtsies prettily                          and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in                          acknowledgement.

Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff                          their hats. Conway does likewise.                                                                                        EXT.

FULL SHOT                                                              Conway is walking along a street in                          the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare,                          unlike anything we have ever seen before.                          The small, one-story huts along its                          very narrow sidewalk are of singularly                          varied architecture - giving the impression                          of being \"homemade.\" As a result of                          this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic                          about them is similar - their cleanliness.                          Something about the atmosphere is fresh                          and wholesome and peaceful. In front                          of several of the huts native women                          sit - some weaving on a tapestry board,                          some nursing babies, some asleep, and                          some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.                                                                                        228. MED. TRUCKING SHOT                                                              With Conway, walking along. As he passes,                          the women smile at him in the most friendly                          fashion. From inside these homes, soft                          and soothing music emanates. At the                          end of the street, Conway finally arrives                          at a garden spot. The suddenness of                          this is startling, too - because of                          its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway                          throws himself at the foot of an overhanging                          tree, and leans against the trunk.                                                                                        ? 535 ?                                                              229.

He remains this way quietly for a few                          seconds, when he is attracted by the                          singing of a chorus of children\\'s voices.                          He glances around.                                                               230. LONG SHOT                                                              From Conway\\'s angle. In the shadow of                          a row of overhanging trees which form                          an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty                          children sing a hymn, or nursery song                          - in English. Sondra (the violin girl                          of previous scenes) stands in front                          of them, a baton in hand, conducting                          them.                                                               231.

He finds himself a comfortable place                          under a tree and sits down. The children,                          still singing, have seen his approach                          and crane their necks curiously.                                                               233.

Then she notices they are                          being distracted and casually turns                          her head. She is somewhat startled at                          seeing Conway, but quickly recovers                          her composure, and smiles wanly.                                                               234.

She turns to the children.

Conway scrambles to his feet and does                          an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.

Sondra, murmuring, \"Of course, dear\"                          and still waving her baton is, for the                          moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning                          to Conway, holds out the baton to him.

And, taking the child by the hand, she                          exits.                                                               240.

He turns                          his head to watch Sondra, and when he                          looks forward again, finds himself off-beat.                          To cover his embarrassment, he smiles                          foolishly.                                                               241. MED.

Do you realize that there is a British                          cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring                          out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings,                          waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London?

My father and mother were in a                          party of explorers who got lost and                          wandered around for a year. When Chang                          found us, only Father and I were alive.                          But he was too weak to climb the pass.                          He died on the way. I was brought up                          here by Father Perrault himself.

I talked                          to him last night.

Am                          I so strange?

I have                          the same idea about Shangri-La. The                          sense that I\\'ve been here before, that                          I belong here.

The very air that                          I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet                          rooted in the good earth of this fertile                          valley, while its head explores the                          eternal. All the beautiful things I                          see, these cherry blossoms, you - all                          somehow familiar.

A crime, a great crime,                          yet I accept it amiably, with the same                          warm amiability one tolerates only from                          a very dear and close friend. Why? Can                          you tell me why?

Just as I\\'m sure there\\'s                          a wish for Shangri-La in everyone\\'s                          heart. I have never seen the outside                          world. But I understand there are millions                          and millions of people who are supposed                          to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know                          that secretly they are all hoping to                          find a garden spot where there is peace                          and security, where there\\'s beauty and                          comfort, where they wouldn\\'t have to                          be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish                          the whole world might come to this valley.

That silly shadow racing                          along over mountains and valleys, covering                          ten times the distance of the plane.

My friend, it is not an arduous                          task that I bequeath, for our order                          knows only silken bonds. To be gentle                          and patient, to care for the riches                          of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while                          the storm rages without.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Do you think this will come in my time?                                                                                        ? 553 ?                                                              276.

You will preserve the fragrance of our                          history, and add to it a touch of your                          own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.

And                          they will all be here, my son, hidden                          behind the mountains in the Valley of                          the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a                          miracle.                                                               The voice of the Lama, toward the last,                          seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly                          engrossed, half-consciously waits for                          it to continue. Following a protracted                          silence, he slowly turns toward the                          Lama. A breeze blows through the room,                          ruffling curtains on the window.                                                               277.

There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed                          mask.                                                               278.

Quite unaware that he                          is being moved emotionally, tears well                          up in his eyes. While still sitting                          this way, unable to stir, he becomes                          conscious of activity around him.                                                                                        279. MEDIUM SHOT                                                              As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive                          - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the                          Lama. Then, in intervals of seconds,                          groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter                          softly and silently, and gather around                          the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable                          murmurs that might or might not be prayers.                          Conway is only vaguely aware of their                          presence - and after a few moments,                          scarcely conscious of what is actuating                          his movements, he drifts away from the                          murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction                          of the door.

Before them they have                          spread a large map or chart.

He is watching a solemn and                          slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers                          - the funeral rites of the High Lama                          - accompanied by cermonial music and                          drum-beating.                                                               284.

For a moment                          he stands uncertainly, and finally enters.

MEDIUM SHOT                                                              As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces                          no emotion whatsoever.                                                               CONWAY                                                              (a murmur)                                                              Hello, George.                                                              George looks at him peculiarly. Conway\\'s                          behavior is odd in view of their strained                          relationship.                                                               GEORGE                                                              Well, you can stop worrying about everything                          now, Bob. I\\'ve made arrangements to                          leave. If you\\'ll let me close that window,                          I can talk to you. That noise is driving                          me crazy.                                                               He closes the window.                                                              GEORGE                                                              I said we\\'re getting out of here. Back                          to civilization. I made a deal with                          the porters. They brought in a load                          of books or something, and they\\'re leaving                          tomorrow at dawn. They\\'re waiting for                          us five miles outside the valley. Come                          on, get your things together. Where\\'s                          your top coat?                                                               288.

You\\'ve                          been acting strangely ever since we                          came here.

Conway combats an impulse to tell him                          the whole story.

Something I\\'ve been searching for all                          my life. The answer to the confusion                          and bewilderment of a lifetime. I\\'ve                          found it, George, and I can\\'t leave                          it. You mustn\\'t either.

You\\'re carrying around a secret that                          seems to be eating you up. If you\\'ll                          only tell me about it.

It\\'s                          weird and fantastical and sometimes                          unbelievable, but so beautiful!

While he is speaking, we slowly                                                              DISSOLVE TO:                                                              289. SAME SCENE:                                                              As Conway is concluding his story.

He died as peacefully as the passing                          of a cloud\\'s shadow. His last words                          to me were, \"I place in your hands,                          my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.\"                          Now you know why I can\\'t leave.                                                               George listens to him intently, his                          face a mask of apprehension. He stares                          at his brother for some time and finally                          rises and walks around for a few moments.

Except that you must be completely                          mad.                                                               ? 558 ?

Good heavens, Bob, things like                          that don\\'t happen today. We\\'re living                          in the twentieth century.                                                               CONWAY                                                              So you think it\\'s all nonsense, huh?                                                                                        290. MED. SHOT - THE TWO                                                              GEORGE                                                              I think you\\'ve been hypnotized by a                          lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why,                          I wouldn\\'t believe it if I heard it                          in an English monastery. Why should                          I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you                          know the things they told you are true?                          Did they show you any proof?                                                               CONWAY                                                              I don\\'t need any proof.

I\\'d give half my life to fly                          over it with a load of bombs just for                          what they\\'ve done to you. How do you                          know the things they told you are true?                          Did they show you any proof? All this                          talk about the Lamas being hundreds                          of years old. How do you know? Did you                          see their birth certificates?                                                               (some more pacing)                                                              I can\\'t believe it, Bob. A bunch of                          decrepit old men sit around and dream                          about reforming the world. And you,                          Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground                          Conway - want to join them. It\\'s horrible.

GEORGE                                                              What else could it mean to me? It\\'s                          obviously a lot of bunk.                                                               CONWAY                                                              Then you\\'d better go, George. This is                          no place for you.

Do you want                          to stay here until you\\'re half dead?                          Until your mind starts corroding like                          the rest of them?                                                               CONWAY                                                              Please, George. I don\\'t want to talk                          about it anymore.                                                               ? 559 ?

You said they stole that plane to                          bring you here. I didn\\'t want to come.                          You owe me some responsibility.                                                               CONWAY                                                              I\\'m tired of owing you things. You\\'re                          free to go. Go ahead.

Do you know what                          will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La?                          She\\'s a fragile thing that can only                          live where fragile things are loved.

Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway.                                                               MARIA                                                              It\\'s all your fault! It was all arranged                          until he spoke to you! Why can\\'t you                          leave us alone?

It was I who bribed the porters.                          If it weren\\'t for me, you\\'d never get                          out!

All they want to know is how much                          gold he will give them. Well, I gave                          them more gold. I\\'ve been stealing it                          for a year.

If it weren\\'t                          for him, I would have been out of here                          long ago, but he always stops me. Six                          months ago, I tried to escape and he                          locked me in a dark room. I nearly went                          crazy.

Is this the skin of an                          old woman? Look into my eyes and see                          if these are the eyes of an old woman?

The chances                          are that we\\'ll never come out of that                          horrible trip alive, but I\\'d rather                          die out there in a snowstorm and be                          buried alive, than to stay here one                          more minute now.

We cannot get a clear view of                          her face. But what we see seems to us                          to be small, withered and aged. She                          is dead.

His face                          lights up with great determination.                          He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks                          away, racing out of scene.

Locked him in room but he escaped us                          and jumped ship during night at Singapore.

During these last                          ten months, that man has done the most                          astounding things. He learned how to                          fly, stole an army plane and got caught,                          put into jail, escaped . . . all in                          an amazingly short space of time. But                          this was only the beginning of his adventures.

Everywhere                          I went, I heard the most amazing stories                          of the man\\'s adventures. Positively                          astounding. Until eventually, I trailed                          him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.                                                                                        348.

       "  '8/4/1993 S P I D E R - M A N Written by Barry Cohen and Ted Newson and James Cameron 2nd Revision by Joseph Goldmari and James Cameron and John Brancato -------- Third Revision by James Cameron based on screenplays by Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Barney Cohen and Joseph Goldman SECOND REV. 7/29/1993 FADE IN: INT. PROFESSOR OCK\"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes. Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE. We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL climbs to \"5% POWER.\" A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL. Begin OPENING CREDITS. THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and there. COBWEBS are all around. DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid-fifties. His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He\\'s open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the school administration and to \"procure\" whatever OCK needs for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS. WEINER Whoa, whoa, whoa... what\\'s that? With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor. OCK (rising) We begin again... let\\'s kick in that new transducer. See if we can double the power output. WEINER (rising more slowly) Whoa, Doc... wait a minute... But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, \"eight, nine...\" the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is shattering. END OPENING CREDITS. OCK Okey... dokey! The POWER DIAL hits ten. EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State University. We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who\\'s among the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women. LIZ (falling in step) Hiya Peter... LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She\\'s beautiful and intelligent. PETER (ardent but uncomfortable) Hiya Liz... how\\'re you doing...? LIZ (teasing softly) How\\'m I doing what? HARRY Peter! Peter! Wait up! HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like Liz. HARRY (to Liz) Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute? Despite PETER\\'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him away like a conspirator. PETER What is it? what... HARRY Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept your paper? PETER (laughs, embarrassed) Yeah... well... all I got\\'s the data but they\\'ve agreed to publish it when it\\'s finished. You know... it\\'s my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction. HARRY And its influence on the anti-force. Isn\\'t it? PETER Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with... (indicates Liz standing there) HARRY Yeah, you and the rest of the class. Every one is busy with Liz. LIZ (growing impatient) Peter? A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom. FLASH Hiya, cupcakes... LIZ (elbowing him affectionately) Flash...! They kiss and walk away. HARRY (sneering) And Flash is the busiest of them all... PETER (disappointed) Come on, Harry... we\\'ll be late for Octavius. HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy. HARRY Ock is nuts, don\\'t you agree? PETER Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated. INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door marked \"Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!\" Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old fashioned professor, he\\'s the head of the Physics Dept. With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK, THORKEL is a natural enemy. ROZ (knocking furiously) Doctor Octavius! You are late for your lecture. The students are waiting. Doctor Octavius! THORKEL Your friend is impossible Professor Rosomorf, I told the board we should let him go. The LIGHT above THORKEL\\'s head EXPLODES. Then all the LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ look amazed... THORKEL What\\'s he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again. ROZ You mean his anti-force theory... one day they\\'ll give him the Nobel Prize for it. THORKEL Meanwhile he is demolishing our university. Octavius!! (knocks) Open the door. INT. OCK\\'S LAB OCK The anti-force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety. Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device... FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms) suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged master at manipulating these WALDOS. He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT marked, \"1,000,000\"), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE. The knock on the door grows louder. WEINER comes up behind OCK. WEINER Whoa, Doc... someone\\'s at the door... OCK (ignoring) World class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron... INSERT: The DIAL marked \"RELATIVE GRAVITY\" reads \"1,000,000\" but suddenly it snaps to \"0.999999!\" OCK Okey! Dokey! The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it appears to lift ever so slightly. INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall. PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can\\'t take his eyes off LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR. LIZ (softly) What is it, Peter? PETER (embarrassed) It\\'s nothing. INT. OCK\\'S LAB WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting impatient. WEINER Yes, gentleman can I help you? THORKEL Tell your boss, that his class is waiting. WEINER (looks) You better tell him yourself. THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both call. ROZ & THORKEL Professor Octavius!! Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men. OCK Gentlemen, come, you must see this. ROZ But, your students... OCK The imbeciles can wait... I have better things to do than teach introductory Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are kindless adolescence. THORKEL You see he is impossible. OCK Thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had. (Thorkel turns to go) Don\\'t go Thorkel!! Come! Look! He starts to play his machines handles and buttons. THORKEL The university pays you to teach something to your students. INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY LIZ Well, do you mean nothing... or do you mean something but you won\\'t tell me what it is? PETER (regaining) I mean plain nothing. LIZ Well, I guess that\\'s about as nothing as you can get... plain nothing. A beat. PETER Liz...! LIZ Ahh, it is something. PETER No... look. The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron\\'s WHINE begin to build... INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears. OCK I am going for 20 percent power! THORKEL NO!! Don\\'t do that... ROZ Ock! Its dangerous... THORKEL Ock I warn you... WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks. INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is making its way up to the LAB! INT. LAB - DAY All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ\\'S TABLE. A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD LIBS: \"Fire!\" \"Everybody out!\" THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second. THORKEL Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the front door. Everybody out the front. PETER Liz! Come on...! LIZ I can\\'t. Help me! PETER I\\'m coming! He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES. His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out. LIZ Peter! Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him. THORKEL Get back, you idiots. You can\\'t go in there! LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz wraps her fingers in the GATE. LIZ (out at the street) Help! Help me! Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can\\'t hear, of course) down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her. PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out. FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER. PETER Thanks for your help Flash. FLASH No problem wimp. PETER Our hero has a real way with words. LIZ Oh, why don\\'t you grow up. PETER is stung, insulted, turns away. ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel. THORKEL This man will bring a disaster upon this university. OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened. OCK The universe is made up of forces... and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE. OCK (continues without a hitch) But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter. PETER (taking place at lab table) Thanks, Professor. THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK\\'S behavior. THORKEL I don\\'t believe it, I simply don\\'t... OCK Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel. THORKEL I don\\'t believe... oh, all right carry on Professor. OCK Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough... THORKEL Wait a minute, wait a minute... you\\'ve got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius. OCK I have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel. THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR. OCK I now believe its possible that these counter forces can be... collected... the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight... and focused into a hard beam I call... Weiner! WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says \"Anti- Force.\" OCK I call it, the Anti-Force! OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with a SILVER BALL inside it. OCK (continues as he works) This anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed... for instance... (looks up maniacally) Gravity! LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word \"gravity.\" Then she turns to PETER. LIZ (whispers) I\\'m sorry... PETER It\\'s alright. OCK is \"playing\" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the Opera at the organ. OCK We patch in the cyclotron... The lights flicker and go dim. OCK Pay no attention to the lights... I of course steal its energy, and it looses power. We patch in the cyclotron... and we gradually apply power. The power that I am stealing... As the WHINE builds in the LAB... OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it. The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron\\'s experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins. It crackles round the SILVER BALL. OCK And so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe... gravity... which is holding down this goddamn ball. Rise! The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS and CATCALLS. HARRY What a crock... PETER Shut up Harry... this is very interesting. OCK Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting observation you\\'d like to share with the class? PETER No sir... OCK Then shut up! And pay some attention to the experiment. OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL begins to rise. OCK\\'S face is ecstatic. OCK Rise! Rise!!! The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a LIGHT FIXTURE. The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist. OCK Now that\\'s what I call an experiment! The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front. TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK depiction of \"space\". OCK You are looking at a representation of two universes. Our Blue one. Our real universe... something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. This is us. The Yellow universe... this is something else. Some other dimension... something... on the other side! OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are BRIGHT GREEN. OCK If it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity... but all our universal forces at the same time. In effect... it would blast a hole between this universe and the next. Each... (indicates green spheres) would flow into each other. No blue universe. No yellow. End, finished, over. LIZ (with a student\\'s ear) That sounds like a scenario for the end of the world. OCK My girl, it is! It is. It would mean wiping out everything that\\'s known... and letting in everything that\\'s unknown. FLASH Isn\\'t that a little dangerous? OCK Don\\'t worry yourself, true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day... Maybe very near... maybe in the 21st century... INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their LOCKERS. LIZ (whispers to Peter) Look, it\\'s just... I don\\'t know... when you and Flash go after each other like that... PETER (whispers) He\\'s not my type. LIZ He doesn\\'t have to be. PETER Check. LIZ And besides, he\\'s not all bad. PETER looks at FLASH who\\'s a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration. PETER You don\\'t get nicknamed Flash because you\\'re a rocket scientist, Liz. LIZ Give it up, Parker. You\\'d die for a nickname like Flash. PETER Yeah, of embarrassment. KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot! KIM (teasing) Hey, Flash... I\\'m scalping a pair of the Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow night. FLASH The Slammies??? I\\'d kill for that!!! KIM Would you pay $125? FLASH Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell you tomorrow? KIM (moving on) You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz... LIZ Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate... Kim Nickson. KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. They go bug-eyed! KIM (interested) Hellooo, Peter. PETER (embarrassed) Hi... LIZ We\\'re going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who\\'s adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah! PETER (frustrated) I can\\'t... I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle. I\\'m trying to sell some photos. KIM Soooh, a photographer...? PETER Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting you, Kim. KIM Yeah... I bet it would be. HARRY Can I be your date for the reunion ShooShoo? KIM No Jerk! HARRY (she turns to go) What did I say... LIZ It\\'s not what you said, it\\'s how you say it, ShooShoo! Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down. HARRY Damn! PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking WEINER. WEINER Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you. PETER About my data I bet. WEINER I don\\'t know. PETER He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn\\'t he? WEINER (lies) I don\\'t know. INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It\\'s a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one but PETER. OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER. He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is OCK\\'S domain. PETER Hello, Professor Octavius. (no response) I really admired your experiment. OCK (back to Peter) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean... PETER (flattered) That would be... great. OCK (turns with a smile) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun... all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. Isn\\'t that the subject of your paper...? PETER Yes sir, I\\'ve worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect. OCK I\\'m a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all... checks out. PETER Well... I\\'m sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that my theory is... well, I don\\'t know... OCK (to himself) The scoundrel... (turns angry) I want to see that data, Peter! PETER But Professor Octavius... if I knew you were interested... sorry, I\\'ve already given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department... and I couldn\\'t... OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly. OCK Well, I\\'m certain something can be worked out. Run along, young man. PETER begins to leave. OCK Just a minute... how about if I show you my discoveries... something I never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all. PETER Well I am really flattered, I mean I\\'d love to... but I... OCK Very well shall we say if you come here tonight... PETER But Professor I don\\'t now if I should... OCK Make it eight sharp... I\\'ll be waiting for you... Right here... Peter looks worried then leaves. OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling. OCK The same academic world that\\'s so keen to embrace that boy\\'s undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is our society coming to? Ha! WEINER They are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that\\'s what I say... OCK Weiner! Go get me that boy\\'s data! WEINER Cost you fifty bucks. OCK (Weiner hissing) Just get it. We\\'ll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright Weiner? EXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A sign says: \"The Daily Bugle.\" Peter enters the building. JAMESON (V.O.) Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage! INT. JAMESON\\'S OFFICE - DAY Very forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as PETER stands helplessly by. JAMESON Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies. PETER Yes, sir. JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This guy is a hard case. JAMESON (looks at the other photos) Little kids... I hate little kids. This is a daily newspaper. We need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit! PETER Yes, sir. JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation. JAMESON Kid? You want a pro\\'s assessment? PETER Yes, sir! JAMESON (handing photos back) Your photos suck. (cigar for emphasis) Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta grab them by the eyes. Every time you press the button of that Nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents. So the next time you\\'re about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man? Because if you are... PETER I know, I know. You want man bites dog... JAMESON Parker, this is the post modern 20th century. I want man eats dog! Get out! EXT. STREET - DAY A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he collects from a beaten down mailbox. PETER (reading) Rent! Rent, more bills, rent... electricity, bills... INT. PETER\\'S APARTMENT - DAY A one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs, wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50\\'s dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight leads to the roof. It\\'s not a pretty place, but it has personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an intruder, is sneaking around. PETER There\\'s nothing in there worth stealing! MAY (V.O.) (from within the kitchen) That\\'s the understatement of the year. PETER Aunt May, you\\'re trespassing. MAY (comes in) I was just so desperately bored... I thought I\\'d come over and make you dinner... PETER I am old enough to... to make my own-- MAY But I didn\\'t feel like getting to know your roaches. PETER I\\'ll introduce you. MAY Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots... PETER I take pictures, remember? MAY Anyway, I\\'ve decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills... She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his shoulder. PETER It\\'s Friday night... MAY Yes. Do you have a date? PETER No. MAY Then come on. INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it, lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ). As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The intruder approaches... THORKEL (at his ear) Professor Rosomorf, what happened here? ROZ Someone tried to rob me of some paper... I suspect they were looking for that one. THORKEL What is it? ROZ (unruffled) Award winning stuff. (turning slightly) Peter Parker\\'s data on the Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another title. THORKEL My God, what\\'s going on in our school? First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab... Now this. You report it in triplicate, of course. ROZ Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius. Remember... the man is a very fragile genius. One day he\\'ll bring us all the Noble Prize. THORKEL Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot! Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to build. ROZ That\\'s him again. He\\'s working day and night. THORKEL I tell you the man is very dangerous. (the whine grows louder) Come on Rosomorf, let\\'s stop him before this building will explode. INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the door. THORKEL Shut it down, Octavius. OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK\\'S shoulder. OCK ignores him too. THORKEL You\\'ve blown half the circuits in the Science Center. OCK Call an electrician. THORKEL I have called the locksmith. OCK What... what is he doing. He points toward the worker who\\'s working on the lock on the main door. THORKEL We have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines. ROZ Please, Otto, we must lock it up. OCK (to Thorkel) You\\'re denying me access to my cyclotron?! THORKEL You bet. OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER, and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE. The WHINE descends. The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The WHINE dies. OCK (contemplating) Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow. I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow... Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room... ROZ Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours won\\'t make a difference. THORKEL I hope. He signals to the worker to stop. INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is perched on BEN\\'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them. BEN Another brewski? PETER No, I\\'m fine, Uncle Ben. BEN (at T.V.) Yah! Way to do it. Alright! (to Peter) You don\\'t follow the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete? PETER No, not so much anymore. BEN Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away... I had this idea... I wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was. Geez, what ever happened to that? PETER Little league. BEN (soft and warm) Yeah... Babe Ruth you wasn\\'t. AUNT MAY enters. AUNT MAY It\\'s on the table! Turn off the TV! BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway. AUNT MAY How\\'s that girl you told us about, Peter? PETER Liz? She\\'s great... But she has a boyfriend. INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat. AUNT MAY A boy your age should have a girlfriend. PETER Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend. AUNT MAY Peter, any girl that\\'s worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend... But if she really gets to know what you have to offer she\\'ll... you get my drift? BEN Look, just leave him alone, okay. When he\\'s ready for girls he\\'ll be a holy terror. (winks) It\\'s in the blood. (now serious business) Lookit, how are you fixed for money, Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little. PETER (lying to them) No, I\\'m alright. My scholarship covers almost everything, and I sell some photos here and there. Today my physics professor asked for some of my work... he wants to study my data. They might publish my work in the science magazine... that\\'ll bring me some money... BEN (practically cheering) Publish your work?! You hear that May...? PETER (embarrassed laughs) Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little early tonight, to meet Professor Octavius... He offered me to be his assistant... BEN Whoa! Did you hear that May...? AUNT MAY Oh, Peter, you promised you\\'d spend the night... PETER I... I can\\'t, Aunt May. Professor Octavius wants to discuss my new findings. AUNT MAY (disappointed) Peter, what you should be finding... is a nice girlfriend. INT. BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE. OCK I\\'ll show them... closing the cyclotron on me... Weiner! WEINER Yes, Professor... OCK Where is he? It\\'s ten past eight o\\'clock... A KNOCK WEINER (with mouth full) That must be him. He opens the door. PETER Good evening. OCK You are late. (to Weiner) Weiner, go outside and get us something to eat. And don\\'t steal it! Just buy it. I\\'ll reimburse you. WEINER (to Peter) Do you want anything Parker? PETER No thank you, I just had dinner at my aunt\\'s... OCK Piss off, Weiner! WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around. He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open WINDOW... and into the chamber. OCK Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like to take Weiner\\'s place... I mean, be my assistant? PETER Well, Professor, that would be a great honor, but I\\'m already working with... OCK Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don\\'t you understand, kid, that I am about to uncover the greatest discovery since Einstein came up with his theory of relativity... The \"Anti-Force.\" PETER Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You should go for the Noble Prize Professor... OCK Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me show you, kid, what I got here. OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber\\'s GEAR. OCK Present maximum anti-force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator... (shrugs) I will now try to reach 50% power... (big breath) And if your paper has any value... I can use it to get the power I\\'m missing to create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish! PETER Sorry, Professor, I can\\'t do it. I gave my word to Professor Rosomorf. OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining starts. An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the \"Relative Gravity\" DIAL. It is at \"4.999999KG\" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly. INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT. INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER! OCK (screaming) 50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent... that\\'s all I\\'m missing! Parker, we can be rich together! PETER Sorry... I\\'d better go now. OCK (really angry now) You\\'ll be sorry, Parker. PETER leaves. Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word, \"OVERLOAD!\" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward! The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB. INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it\\'s shimmering WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in time with the THROB and PULSE. INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The MONITOR is flashing \"MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!\" OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the SPIDER! OCK You! Get out of there, you creeping... He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand. INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto the PROFESSOR\\'s back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR\\'s neck and bites him. OCK (anguish) Noooooooooooo! The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as OCK\\'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which erupts like the 4th of JULY. OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like snakes. OCK\\'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES! OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with SPARKS. OCK (ecstasy above the din) It\\'s an energy storm! Okey! Dokey! We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck. The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the CYCLOTRON\\'s side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO- STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction. INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way. The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE- WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then, suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK\\'S lab, singing, not at first noticing what\\'s going on. Suddenly he stops dead. INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT A scene out of DALI\\'s surrealistic canvas. There are things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI watches. This place has been rippled to the max! OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body. The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body, like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees OCK. WEINER Professor... what happened to you? What did you do... Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor. INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT WEINER Oh my God... what happened here... He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away. WEINER I better get out of here. EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn. POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students and general gawkers. J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it. The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR, stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to address the CROWD. THORKEL (through bull horn) There is no danger. Please go back to your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger. JAMESON (approaches him) Spill it out, Professor! The public wants to know! The CROWD closes on THORKEL. THORKEL Who are you? JAMESON Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now what really happened here? THORKEL There will be a press announcement in the morning Mr. Jameson... now if you\\'ll excuse me. This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: \"I heard a terrible explosion?\" \"Nuclear accidents?\" \"Meltdown?\" \"Genetic engineering?\" \"Are you guys making mutants in there?\" THORKEL I have nothing to say... there will be an announcement. Now, please go home... everybody... we must clear the grounds... In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and KIM. FLASH You think they\\'ll cancel classes? HARRY They must... the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas. PETER How about nuclear contaminations? KIM My God... lets beat it. But nobody moves. LIZ (more interested in other things) Could anyone be in there, Peter? PETER (concerned) I don\\'t know... Maybe Professor Octavius. He usually works late... FLASH That nut, I bet it was all his doing... JAMESON (seeing Peter) Hey Parker! Peter Parker! PETER pushes forward. PETER Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here? What\\'s going on? JAMESON That\\'s for them to know, and for you to find out. PETER But sir, they wouldn\\'t tell us. You heard Thorkel... he said... JAMESON A press announcement tomorrow...! But we must know tonight Parker. This is your university, right... PETER Yes, but... JAMESON You got your camera? PETER Sure, but I can\\'t-- JAMESON A hundred dollars says you can? PETER Yes sir! JAMESON Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks. PETER You just said a hundred. JAMESON Seventy, but I want blood and gore. PETER (calling back) Seeya guys. He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this guy. LIZ Where is he going? JAMESON To make fifty bucks. EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails ignominiously in a heap. He\\'s torn his PANTS and cut his leg. He moves to the side of the building. A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It\\'s locked. As PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and falls in. INT. DUMPSTER - NIGHT PETER lays in the GARBAGE, a pained look on his face. He rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE. The headline reads, \"Wave of Violence Rips City!\" He pulls himself up and peers out. He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects. When they let the DOOR swing closed, PETER stops it by inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top. EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him. INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT Skewed, strange, surreal, PETER stares at the weirdness and fumbles with his CAMERA. He snaps off a few shots, then freezes when he hears a familiar voice. ROZ (V.O.) (filtered through face mask) Take it easy. Take it easy with him. THORKEL (V.O.) Take him away and never bring him back! Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK in a stretcher. They all wear RADIATION SUITS. A waldo sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast as lightning. He falls back. He\\'s covered with a SHEET and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Octavius moans. THORKEL What was that? ROZ What was what? THORKEL What hit me? ROZ What hit you? THORKEL I don\\'t know. It was so fast. ROZ You\\'re going to be fine, Otto. PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN\\'S room leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak. A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER\\'S eyes go wide at the sight. What in the hell has happened here? INT. MEN\\'S ROOM - NIGHT The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes. PIPES are exposed and spout WATER. The MIRRORS look like something out of a funhouse. PETER hears the STRETCHER go by. PETER goes to the DOOR of OCK\\'S Lab and cracks it. PAN up to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING STRAND above PETER. As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move. The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of PETER\\'s hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites. PETER Ow!!! PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. Sweat starts to bead on PETER\\'S face. He shakes his head to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches against a WEIRD SINK. PETER\\'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. It\\'s all of that! GUARD (V.O.) (heavily distorted) Hey! What are you doing here, kid? PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his crazy vision. PETER I feel a little funny... GUARD (heavily distorted) Yeah? Well, I ain\\'t laughing. Get out... Just get out of here... EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws his BACK PACK at him. GUARD (still distorted) You get yourself over to the Police lines. PETER (ultra wooz) Right. Police lines. EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON appears at his side. JAMESON (distorted) Okay, scoop, whaddaya got? PETER I... got pictures of the Professor... in there... it\\'s so strange in there... so bizarre... JAMESON (winks) Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need. Pick this up in the morning. (holding up his camera) There\\'ll be two crisp twenties tucked inside. He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is gone. He\\'s okay. He makes his way through the crowd to the street. We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN. An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits PETER who leaps to avoid it. EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT PETER\\'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his eyes and sees that he\\'s hanging onto the side of the building like a spider. And he\\'s three stories up! He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him! And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away. He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And then another. Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he \"crawls\" to the roof of the building. At the top he gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the roof one-handed. EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands. On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW disappears. PETER (mutters to himself) This is weird. My God, I feel so weird... He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of \"jumping jacks\" and on the third jump he soars into the air! PETER (exhilarated) Very weird. The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air. With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL where he lands sideways and sticks. PETER (sideways) Very, very weird. He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof. He looks down. No one\\'s looking back. So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof. EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and across the street. PETER bites his lip. PETER Well, what the hell!! EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top! He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room. EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED LIGHTER. In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time to see PETER make it to the next FACADE. EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop. Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT follows PETER\\'S progress. PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH. He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across which he does a \"bug crawl\" and leaps again. He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP. He\\'s so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene gestures. PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH. EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD. REISS You\\'re a kid who\\'s going places, and I\\'m gonna point you the right way. PETER (reading card) Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort girls, blue movies... REISS Oops... sorry, wrong card. (exchanges cards) PETER Max Reiss, Talent management. REISS It\\'s a big outfit. Got a lot of departments. PETER Yeah... well... why you approach me? I\\'m not... REISS Oh yes you are... very talented. The three questions of show business success. One do you think you possess a unique talent? PETER Well... REISS Two... what are you gonna do with it? PETER (not a clue) Well... I don\\'t know. REISS (the clincher) Three... how much money you got in your pocket? PETER Ten. REISS You invest half of that with me and I\\'ll make you a star. PETER (laughing) What are you talking about? REISS I\\'m talking about fame. I\\'m talking about fortune. I\\'m talking about the chance of a lifetime. How\\'d you like to be on MTV tomorrow night? PETER MTV...? Me? Really? REISS Taxi! It screeches to a stop. PETER Hey! REISS (getting in) Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same time. PETER (calling after) How do you know I\\'ll show up? As the TAXI roars off... REISS (from the taxi window) Because you wanna be a star... everybody does. PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He dials. PETER Hello? Aunt May? AUNT MAY (V.O.) (filtered) Peter? What time is it? Are you alright? PETER Well, no, I mean yeah I\\'m fine, but listen... Aunti, the craziest thing happened to me tonight. INT./ EXT. PHONE BOOTH/AUNT MAY\\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully AUNT MAY (lovingly) Does this have to do with a certain girl we talked about at dinner? PETER No, no, look, there was this radioactive experiment... I was poisoned! AUNT MAY You were what? PETER I was bitten by a bug. AUNT MAY Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug. PETER No... No... A spider... AUNT MAY Peter, did you at least talk to her? PETER Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on the hand... by a poisonous spider. AUNT MAY She bit you? PETER No. I was in the bathroom and... AUNT MAY Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter, this is craziness, why don\\'t you use your bed? You\\'re up all night. You\\'re in the radioactive labs. You never take time to eat or sleep. Am I right? PETER Yes, Aunt May. INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT AUNT MAY (V.O.) Did you eat something today? PETER Yes, Aunt May. AUNT MAY (V.O.) Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember we love you. PETER And I love you too, Aunt May. (hangs up) And by the way, I got a mess of super powers today. Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and-- jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof. INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the SENSORS attached to OCK\\'S head. These seasoned professionals are astonished and frightened. CHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Look at these brainwave readings. The mental activity is ten times of any normal man...! BRAINMAN (whispers) Equipment malfunction...? CHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Hell, yeah... his. (checks Ock\\'s chest) My God... I thought I\\'d seen everything... SURGEON #2 (whispers) But this is beyond medicine. This is madness...! OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed. He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part organic, part molybdenum steel. NURSE (leaning in, blitzed) It is so freaky... CHIEF SURGEON (stern for the staff\\'s sake) Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking. I want to go in at the upper thoracic. Then we\\'ll work our way around. (slaps Ock\\'s shoulder) Hang in there, man. INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly. The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns back. The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS. CHIEF SURGEON (glares) Nurse! Number seven scalpel. Arthroscope stand by. Read out parameters in progress. Let\\'s go in. You alright? NURSE Yes... Yes, of course. Everything\\'s online. CHIEF SURGEON Scalpel! No... no... a larger one... the largest we have! She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him. The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel. We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING BELLS and BUZZERS sound. HEAD NURSE Kill the alarms! BRAINMAN He\\'s going off the chart! A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating TABLE and clanks tight! CHIEF SURGEON Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up! SURGEON #2 We\\'re losing him. Defibrillate! A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically. CHIEF SURGEON Zap him! BRAINMAN Stabilizing alpha waves... SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY NURSE You have a visitor, Doctor... She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone. THORKEL (enjoying this) Octavius, I\\'m afraid I have bad news for you. OCK The cyclotron is damaged... THORKEL What used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon. OCK But my work! THORKEL Your work is a disaster! Look at yourself! OCK Myself? I don\\'t matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own... THORKEL What are you saying? OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms. OCK Destroy life. Life is... insignificant. Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say? THORKEL Oh, my God, what are those horrible things sticking from your body? OCK (gets more and more excited) Thorkel, if I told you that for one moment in time I broke all the laws! For one brief glorious moment, I broke through to the other side. I saw... I felt... I became creation. THORKEL What on Earth are you rambling about? OCK Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so clearly now. Universal destruction, yes. All I need is the power... then I can destroy this illusion you call life. It is my destiny to lead us to the light! THORKEL You\\'re a madman. OCK And you are a fool. I will end the universe as you know it. And in that final moment... I\\'ll laugh my ass off while you\\'re kissing yours goodbye! THORKEL (excited) Goodbye is right, Octavius... You\\'re fired... sacked... canned. You are history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn\\'t be more pleased to be the first to tell you this good news... A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches from the ceiling. THORKEL (his last words) Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER! Let me down! Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL\\'S head through the ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL\\'S legs scissor and kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS. OCK Okey, dokey. INT. TAXI - NIGHT Through the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. As it pulls up, a sign reads, \"Midnight Madness! MTV\\'s Rock and Wrestling \\'SLAMMY Awards!\" The TAXI come to a stop. PETER (looking up at the sign) MTV Wrestling?! REISS (getting out) That\\'s the place. Pay the man. MAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX. PETER Look, Mr. Reiss... I\\'m not real interested in watching a wrestling match. REISS Who said anything about watching a wrestling match? You\\'re here to win a wrestling match! PETER Me? You must be kidding. REISS hustles PETER inside. REISS You hop around. You know, the way you did last night. Your opponent gets tired. He falls down. The ref counts to three, you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks. INT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT We can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM and shows him the BOX. REISS You\\'re really gonna love this. PETER Look, really, I don\\'t know... REISS You don\\'t have to know. I know enough for both of us. (pause) Change in there. PETER What is this? REISS A costume... something that fits your talent. Go put it on. I\\'m sure you\\'ll like it. He slaps the BOX against PETER\\'S chest and all but pushes him inside. INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT PETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to struggle into it. PETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes. He smoothes his hair. He\\'s starting to get into it. INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT CRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent. INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT REISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS. PETER (comes out) How does it look? I feel like it\\'s Halloween. REISS Cover your face with the mask. PETER Why? REISS Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know who you are... INT. THE RING - NIGHT CRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and BANNERS proclaiming the \"SLAMMIES\" everywhere. RING ANNOUNCER And now, a new challenger, for the thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one hundred and fifty pounds... from parts unknown! Here is the Amazing... Mysterious... Incredible Superman... REISS (snorts from ringside, hating the name) No, not Superman... Spider-Man... SPIDER-MAN!!! RING ANNOUNCER ...Spider-Man!!!!! The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in RED BIKINIS ring a bell. CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice SPIDEY\\'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER sneer. Then he charges! With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way. CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger! The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt from the CROWD. OLD LADY Kill the sucker, Crusher! SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the CAMERAS. HIPSTER (between two blondes) Whatsamatter, Crusher, can\\'t you crush that bug? CRUSHER (to Spidey) Okay, Web Face, this is it! He misses SPIDEY again! HIPSTER Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide! (his blondes titter) INT. LIZ/KIM\\'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT LIZ\\'S side is all schoolwork. KIM\\'S side is all ROCK POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed watching the \"SLAMMIES\" on MTV. FLASH Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He is absolutely incredible! KIM Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I had it for the Halloween party... it\\'s quite sexy. LIZ Will you two shush. I\\'m trying to work. INT. RING - NIGHT The match continues in an increasingly spectacular choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD. But there\\'s a gleam in his eye. This is it! He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he\\'s worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner. CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering him. The CROWD goes WILD. REF One...! REISS Get up...! Get up...! REF Two...! Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time. CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back! The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who break into utter hysterics. SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER land. SPIDER-MAN (whispers to himself) Wow... REF Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made today, we have here the first man to win a thousand dollars against the mighty Crusher. The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly, recognizing the new sensation. SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the CHEERS. PETER Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand... REISS We are going to get a thousand-- PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER COLE. Two ominous beats. CRUSHER Hi, who are you, kid? PETER I\\'m Peter Parker. REISS He is Spider-Man, and I handle him... Whenever you want a rematch call me. Next time it\\'s gonna be ten thousand, what do you say... Crusher? SPIDER-MAN Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I\\'m really sorry about what happened in there. Really... CRUSHER Oh, well, I don\\'t know what happened to me tonight... (measures his muscles) I really don\\'t know... REISS I know... you lost. Big man you lost to the Amazing Spider-Man. EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN\\'S face. Headline: \"Who is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!\" The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is rocking on his heels and smirking. PETER (indicating truck) You know who that is? LIZ (walking ahead) Yeah... he\\'s some clown we saw on TV last night... boy does Flash think he\\'s hot. PETER He does... KIM I love wrestling. HARRY Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really believe this little guy in a stupid Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher? LIZ Hey, we better rush... visiting hours will be over soon. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY The NURSE leads PETER and LIZ and HARRY into the room. NURSE Doctor Octavius? You have visitors. Doctor Octavius? We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her. PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up too. OCK is not there. PETER Ock is not here! LIZ My God, what happened? NURSE I\\'d better call the doctor! HARRY You\\'d better call the police! KIM screams. INT. CORRIDOR TO OCK\\'S LAB - DAY OCK, hiding his WALDOS under a white hospital robe. He stalls until he reaches the door. Then one of his WALDOS peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT OCK, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal debris. Two WALDOS reach out and \"sense\" the ripples on opposite WALLS. He runs a hand through his hair. OCK What a wreck. What a useless, wasted wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter! A world class, super cyclotron! He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage. WEINER There you are, doc... where have you been... whoa this place is messed up. OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once. WEINER (smirks) Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up yourself. OCK Where have you been, you imbecile? WEINER I went to the wrestling... OCK Wrestling... WEINER I went after the kid. You still want that Parker guy\\'s data, don\\'t you? OCK Well, did you get it? WEINER No, I followed him... but I lost him in the crowd. OCK Lost him? You-- WEINER I\\'ll find him, Maestro... I promise... soon... maybe by tomorrow. OCK So how was the wrestling? WEINER Fantastic! There was this new wrestler... beat the mighty Crusher. You won\\'t believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls himself this stupid name... the Amazing Spider-Man... would you believe it? OCK Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I\\'ll just go and wrestle myself one of these days... with all my new arms... I\\'m sure I can beat Crusher or any other monster. Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air, smiles cynically and with cruelty! OCK Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I beat him or not? WEINER No... no, please... I mean yes, yes... you\\'ll beat him easily... let me down... Please... I\\'ll do anything for you... OCK The Parker data... get me the Parker data, you hear?!!! EXT. PETER PARKER\\'S ROOFTOP - DAY A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds down and it CLICKS. REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA\\'S POV. SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL. SPIDER-MAN And one like this... (changing pose) And one looking real sincere. The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK. Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He hides. WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps in and grabs him. SPIDER-MAN What are you doing here? WEINER I\\'m looking for Peter Parker. SPIDER-MAN Oh, yes... so why not use the front door? SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN. WEINER Hey, I know you... SPIDER-MAN You do? WEINER I saw you crushing the Crusher. SPIDER-MAN You like wrestling? SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER. WEINER I love it! You are the best wrestler I have ever seen... please don\\'t hurt me! SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately. SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna. WEINER Oh, please... don\\'t kill me. Please help me down. SPIDER-MAN Of course I\\'ll help you down. I am Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not? WEINER Yes... yes, you are. SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his arms and whispers to him. SPIDER-MAN And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore... SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of the roof. SPIDER-MAN And tell the Professor he can\\'t have Peter\\'s data. Goodbye. SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors straight down into heavy bushes below. INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long list of items OCK has ordered. CLERK Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a cyclotron? (Ock glares at him) Okay... lets see here. Page three.

STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the Bank\\'s DOORS. Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER\\'S SIDE WINDOW of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER\\'S NECK and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out through his WINDOW. TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR DOOR. BANK GUARD What\\'s going on here? The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS. OCK Cash! INT. JAMESON\\'S OFFICE - DAY A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER\\'S latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots. PETER Doesn\\'t he look amazing in that one? Look, he\\'s flying in the air! JAMESON I don\\'t care if he flies to the moon. He\\'s just another wrestler in a silly costume. Look at this, Parker, right off the wire. This is the guy who hit that armored truck this morning. They say he has metal arms... get me a picture of this character! PETER Metal arms? JAMESON Four of them. PETER Ock...?! JAMESON The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a Halloween costume... don\\'t make me laugh. He tears up PETER\\'S SPIDEY PHOTOS. JAMESON Now get out of here and don\\'t come back without something I can use! PETER Yes sir... (stops, and turns back) JAMESON A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights... what next? PETER The Journal said he was a mega-smash on MTV... INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO! OCK (turning from work) What do you think you\\'re doing? WEINER I\\'m going to the Masquerade. It\\'s Halloween tonight Doc, aren\\'t you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go without an outfit. A WALDO whips around WEINER\\'S throat... AARRRGH! OCK You\\'re not going to any ball, clown. You\\'re going to get me Peter Parker\\'s data... WEINER I was almost killed on my last try... Look at all these bruises... OCK I don\\'t care if you come back dead. Just get it! WEINER (croaking) Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it. The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER\\'S throat. WEINER All right... boss please let go... P L E A S E ... OCK Just get it, Weiner. I\\'m running out of time. If you fail me again, you won\\'t have to concern yourself with money anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?! WEINER croaks his assent. INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS, GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN; PETER wears his regular clothes. HARRY You should have worn a costume. I told you to wear a costume. PETER It\\'s... embarrassing. HARRY There\\'s Liz... LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS. PETER Yeah... ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over. ROZ ... howdy partners. PETER/HARRY Hiya, Professor Rosomorf. HARRY Any word on Doctor Octavius? ROZ (falling in step) Nothing beyond what I read in the papers. I\\'m afraid he\\'s not the same man we knew. You know, I\\'ve been digging through the notes on his experiments... PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN! PETER\\'S eyes go wide. ROZ You boys must have had an extraordinary classroom experience. PETER (eyeing Spidey) Yes sir... oh... I\\'m going to be a little late with my paper on the Planetary Conjunction, sir... ROZ Whenever you\\'re ready... I\\'ll look at it. I know it\\'s going to be an important work... and Peter, take my hat. He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT. ROZ It is a costume party. PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to the table. PETER can\\'t take his eyes off SPIDEY. HARRY Look, there\\'s Spider-Man! PETER Not the real one, I\\'m sure... HARRY You can never be sure... all kinds of crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade ball... PETER I bet I know who it is. As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying to read the BUGLE\\'S sports section by party light. KIM waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face. PETER Hiya, Liz... LIZ moves to Flash, who\\'s dressed in the SPIDER-MAN costume. LIZ Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man costume? PETER It\\'s a very clever outfit you\\'ve got there, Flash. FLASH Take a hike, asshole. LIZ (to Peter) How did you recognize him? PETER His pretty blue eyes give him away... HARRY Anyway, who\\'ll be sitting with you at the Halloween Ball? LIZ (whispers to Flash) I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall we Flash dance? FLASH/SPIDER-MAN Hey, I\\'m reading the paper, okay? LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his chance. HARRY nudges him. HARRY Take her now, it\\'s easy... HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE SUIT. HARRY Wanna dance, Schechrezaa? KIM I\\'m pooped. LIZ I\\'m not... She reaches for HARRY\\'S hand. FLASH Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is this guy great or what? LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks. LIZ Hey, Peter! These are your pictures! FLASH Can\\'t be... LIZ It says here \"Photos by Peter Parker.\" PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH\\'S other shoulder. INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper. PETER BLUSHES, smiling. FLASH (takes off his head mask) You know this guy, Parker? PETER Well, yeah... sort of... FLASH Wow... I\\'ll give you anything if you introduce us. HARRY (to Liz) Will you grant me this dance...? LIZ joins him provocatively. KIM Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...? FLASH Well, why not. PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance. At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM. She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT. She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS as the bad stops. YOUNG WOMAN Thank you, thank you. We have a special surprise guest tonight. (booo) The Empire State University Masquerade Ball presents... The \"Slammy\" winning star of MTV\\'S wrestling tournament... The Amazing Spider-Man! FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and mouths, \"Me?\" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs. FLASH (whispers firmly) Go ahead... go ahead! LIZ takes SPIDEY\\'S hand and they move slowly and sexily onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number. SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH. LIZ (to Flash) Come on... Flash... FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN). LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers. The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number in film history. He\\'s all over the floor and on the walls and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops in a pose. BIG CHEERS. LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN\\'S face. LIZ (whispers breathless) Who are you...? PETER One day you\\'ll know... LIZ (a long beat) You sound very familiar. PETER/SPIDER-MAN Sure I do... I\\'m your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and LIZ in love. INT. BEN AND MAY\\'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated as usual. It\\'s all ROCK VIDEOS! BEN (to May) What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and roll\\'s screwed up the whole TV. He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who\\'s asleep on the couch. He gently nudges her.

CABBIE What\\'m I in, a race? SPIDER-MAN (fighting his fear) I don\\'t know... I get this tingling in my brain, like some danger is lurking just ahead. I\\'m worried about Aunt May and Uncle Ben... CABBIE Your family? SPIDER-MAN Well, they are kind of my parents. They raised me. I lost both of my parents in a car accident... please step on it! CABBIE Step on it... so now you want to kill yourself in another accident... not with me, Boychick. SPIDER-MAN But I\\'m telling you... I\\'ve got this-- CABBIE ... tingling... I know.

DETECTIVE (compassionate) Excuse me. You the nephew? PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle... DETECTIVE Your uncle\\'s a brave man. Apparently, the perpetrator was after something of yours. Your uncle didn\\'t know what it was but he stood up to him anyway. You ought to be proud of him. PETER I am... how is he... A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to them... MAY stands up slowly. DETECTIVE Ask the Doctor. AUNT MAY How\\'s my... how\\'s my husband doing...? DOCTOR Mrs. Parker, I\\'m sorry.

WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to evade them. INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT Thinking they\\'re shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In the corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW. He aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way. The frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow SPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit by the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly. SPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind WEINER, landing a pose. SPIDER-MAN (cold, hard) Say your prayers, Weiner! WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS. WEINER You ain\\'t takin\\' me... Spider-Man... who ever you are... SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in cascades of COLOR. SPIDER-MAN (hanging on ceiling) Hey, creep! WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK marked \"CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!\" SPIDER-MAN (taunting) Try again. The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and takes aim. SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM. He\\'s sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the SOLVENT works against his sticking power. He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning! SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit. He backs down a \"corridor\" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another can. They\\'re following the trail of SOLVENT he\\'s dripping! He\\'s trapped! COP (V.O.) (on bullhorn) This is your last chance, you two. Either you\\'re coming out, or we\\'re coming in! SPIDEY\\'S against the WALL! PAINT CANS to his right and left, and a RIVER of RED FLAME joins the YELLOW and BLUE as they creep toward him! He climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the BLAZE. The COLORED FIRES join and follow him up the wall! They\\'re licking at his feet! WEINER (at the window) Stay back! (gun burst) Whoa... stay back down there! SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames. But the PIPE begins to bend! The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and puts out the FIRE. SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head. WEINER Stand up, you. SPIDEY stands. COP (V.O.) You have thirty seconds to come out! WEINER You\\'re my ticket outa here. Gimme that stupid mask! SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK, but stops and shakes his head no. WEINER Then I\\'ll take it myself. He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes ensnared. SPIDER-MAN Well, look what we\\'ve caught in our web... WEINER Don\\'t hurt me, man. Please don\\'t hurt me... INT.

OCK (reading dials and numbers) Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable differential... good enough. He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down. OCK Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker\\'s data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it... I can\\'t trust anybody. (throws his Waldo in the air) Only you, my babies... only you can I trust... Okay... If I have to do everything myself... I\\'m going to do it. (to his equipment) I\\'ll be back... my babies... my new babies! OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room. INT.

Well... how are you going to get it home? LIZ walks into the room. LIZ Taxi... I guess. She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up around the apartment. LIZ You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don\\'t you think you ought to unplug that! PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall. Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down. PETER (embarrassed) I, uh, I\\'ll go down to the corner... see it I can hail that taxi. PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he so...? INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not notice him. INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT There\\'s a KNOCK at the DOOR. LIZ (crossing to it, wondering) Peter...? She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered doorway, WALDOS writhing. LIZ Doctor Octavius...! You\\'re... You\\'re... (finds the words) You\\'re so weird!... with those... what do you call those... OCK Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man? (moving Waldos like spider\\'s legs) That\\'s me... the real Spider-Man... now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours... Parker? LIZ (protecting) Peter?... oh... he\\'s not here. He\\'s gone. I don\\'t think he\\'ll be back for awhile. OCK (running his Waldo in her hair) You wouldn\\'t lie to your Professor now, would you? LIZ Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He\\'s... out. OCK We\\'ll wait. OCK grabs LIZ\\'S HAIR with his WALDOS. LIZ What are you doing... let me go! Please... take those things out of my hair! OCK My Waldos, you mean. LIZ Whatever you call them... please... OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to the TABLE. OCK Sit. She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his chest. OCK (chatty) He\\'s a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe, but nice, wouldn\\'t you say? LIZ Oh, I don\\'t know. Maybe. He\\'s very inexperienced. ONE of OCK\\'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms immediately. OCK You know, you\\'re a fascinating young lady... LIZ Thank you... OCK You\\'re so refreshing. You\\'re so... LIZ Shocking...? OCK (gone to far) Oh, I wouldn\\'t say shocking... LIZ I would! She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the \"cartoon cat.\" LIZ runs out the door. OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase. INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT LIZ burst from the DOOR. LIZ Peter...! She looks both ways for PETER, doesn\\'t see him, and takes off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ. EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining quickly. EXT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER. PETER Wait here... INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT He walks in. It\\'s empty PETER Liz? LIZ (V.O.) (screaming from the street) Peter! Help! Peter! PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes. EXT. STREET - NIGHT LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She can\\'t outrun him. She must hide. There\\'s a CONSTRUCTION SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it. INT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT LIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK\\'S WALDOS stretch out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS. OCK Peter Parker has something I want... And I\\'m going to have something he wants. She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO ELEVATOR. INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT She looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a flash. He tears the outer DOOR away. LIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its front door. LIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below, shaking the torn off door in a rage. EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside. EXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She\\'s on nothing but a narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to the top. He looks across at her. She\\'s stuck between two unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a WALDO toward her. She\\'s got no place to run, no place to hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the GIRDER. SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Put her down, Ock. OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall building, is SPIDER-MAN. SPIDER-MAN I know what\\'s happening to you, Ock. I\\'ve been through a lot of changes myself lately. You have to listen to me. OCK (holding Liz) Who the hell are you? SPIDER-MAN Spider-Man. LIZ (seeing Spidey) Spider-Man... OCK That\\'s a lot of crap, clown... I am Spider-Man, not you. (points to Liz) Ask you girlfriend. (to Liz) Tell him! SPIDER-MAN I\\'m a good friend of Peter Parker\\'s Ock. Just like that girl you\\'re holding. Now let her go. OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories up. OCK Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I\\'ll let her go. LIZ Put me down, you mechanical mutant! LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She twists. She flails around, making things a little worse. The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP! PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets! SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short. LIZ (falling away) You jerk! He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound. LIZ (straightening herself) Tell your friend Peter next time I\\'ll get the taxi myself... OCK (screams) Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man... Prepare to meet your death, bug. SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK. SPIDER-MAN (whispers) Actually, I\\'m rather fond of living... especially now... (he looks at Liz) He lands on OCK\\'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street. SPIDER-MAN (a last appeal to reason) Octavius. Just stop and think. OCK I am thinking, insect. I\\'m thinking about exterminating you! SPIDER-MAN Okay, if that\\'s the way you want it... Let\\'s see what those chrome knuckles can do, Doc... A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw. It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and rolls over. He rubs his jaw. LIZ Great... SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above. OCK Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown. OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY off the GIRDER. He\\'s just barely hanging on. But SPIDER-MAN\\'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER- ADVERSARIES engage in battle. With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY, they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the CONSTRUCTION SITE. OCK Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will be able to stop me. SPIDER-MAN Stop you from what...? OCK My destiny! OCK throws his biggest punch yet. SIRENS can now be heard in the street. SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY\\'S agility soon has him turning circles. SPIDER-MAN Over here, Octopus! OCK That\\'s Professor Octopus to you Spider Jerk! SPIDER-MAN Give it up, Professor. You\\'ll never catch me! OCK takes three steps and soars through the air. EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into an alley! Screaming all the way... EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing walls. It\\'s a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley. SPIDER-MAN So long, sucker. EXT. STREET - NIGHT COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them. EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight. EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE. COP #1 There he is! COP #2 It\\'s that Spider-Man! EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing BILLBOARD, he\\'s weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER. LIZ What do you think you\\'re doing? SPIDER-MAN I\\'m rescuing you. With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away on a WEB-STRAND. LIZ Thanks but nooooooooooo! EXT. THE COP CARS - NIGHT ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY\\'S movement. COP #2 He won\\'t get away this time! COP #1 Hold your fire! He\\'s got a girl. COP #2 Looks like he\\'s got a hostage. EXT. WEB STRAND - NIGHT SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ whoops with the G-force. LIZ Wait a minute. Where are you taking me? SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl. SPIDER-MAN I better just take you back where you belong. He shoots out another WEB. SPIDER-MAN Hold on tight. LIZ (Times Square) Where are we? SPIDER-MAN Open your eyes. They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It\\'s an extraordinary sight. LIZ (the Empire State Building) If you\\'re trying to impress me Spidey, I want you to know I\\'m not easy. Okay, I\\'m impressed... now put me down, Spidey... put me down. SPIDER-MAN I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody calls me Spidey... now we go... EXT. DORMITORY - NIGHT They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the building\\'s SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in the DORMITORY BUILDING. LIZ (Tavern on the Green) Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute... there\\'s Flash, if I\\'m not mistaken. SPIDER-MAN Liz? LIZ You know my name? SPIDER-MAN Liz, listen to me. There\\'s something I have to tell you. LIZ Okay, put me down and we can talk, alright? SPIDER-MAN Do you know who I am? LIZ All I know is you\\'re the Amazing Spider-Man... or better you\\'re Spidey the good guy on the block... you\\'re a weirdo in a clown spider suit. SPIDER-MAN And that\\'s all you know about me? (a beat, a sigh) Okay, lets get your boyfriend. LIZ Which one? SPIDER-MAN How many do you have? I meant Flash. LIZ Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend... SPIDER-MAN He\\'s not? Then who is? LIZ There\\'s someone I like, but he\\'s too shy to notice. (Flash appears) SPIDER-MAN Flash! FLASH Liz! (a beat) SPIDER-MAN!!! LIZ (to Spider-Man) You know everybody... Flash we have to call Peter! FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There\\'s a NEWSPAPER in his hand. FLASH Hey, they won\\'t let up, man! (shows Daily Bugle) They keep calling you an accomplice in that burglary murder. But that\\'s a crock, ain\\'t it? I\\'m with you, Spidey, 100% SPIDER-MAN Thanks. FLASH (realizing) By the way, what are you doing with... Liz? SPIDER-MAN She needed a lift. FLASH Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of beer! SPIDER-MAN Thanks, but I have some business to take care of. FLASH Well... take care of that later. Wait here. I\\'ll get the beer. He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES. LIZ (accusatory) How\\'d you know this was Flash\\'s place? SPIDER-MAN Peter Parker told me all about it. LIZ Peter told you all about Flash? SPIDER-MAN No... he told me all about you. See you later. (he jumps away) INT. DORM - NIGHT FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry. FLASH Hey, where\\'d he go? Hey, Spider-Man!! But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared. LIZ (distracted) Peter told your Hero all about me... FLASH He would, wouldn\\'t he... that jerk! EXT. PETER PARKER\\'S ROOF - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT. INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the floor. PETER pulls a file marked \"Planetary Conjunction.\" He opens it. A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, \"Kiss it goodbye, Wall Crawler!\" PETER (whispers angrily) Octavius!!! EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself wonderfully. PETER (hurrying by) Kim! Have you seen Harry? KIM Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac... PETER Yeah... have you seen him today? KIM No, un unh. LIZ (catching up) Peter...! PETER (keeps walking) Hi... have you seen Harry? LIZ No. What a night, huh? PETER (laughs) Yeah, that was some ride home... must have been pretty exciting. LIZ It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go? PETER Sorry... I\\'m really busy... I mean, not tonight... see you later. LIZ (thinking) Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...? PETER What about last night? LIZ My exciting ride with Spider-Man... PETER Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to find Harry... I\\'ll see you later. LIZ Peter! PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it. PETER Hey! Can I get a lift downtown? FLASH Take your shoes for a walk, Dork. FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward LIZ. INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY OCK is hard at work. The room, still rippled, has been \"hot rodded\" to the max. Lots of jerry-rigged stuff has been added. OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small TAPE RECORDER. OCK We are new inserting Peter Parker\\'s data on tonight\\'s Planetary Conjunction. INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker\\'s name and ID number and the title, \"The Planetary Conjunction and it\\'s effect on Earth Gravity.\" OCK Yes, yes! Go on! Go on! INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN, JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER rises. OCK Enormous. It\\'s enormous. (to recorder) The Parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. (hits some keys) Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get... He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC \"HOLE\" opening up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is swallowing everything! OCK I knew it. I knew it! Universal destruction! It\\'s doable! I am putting a countdown clock on the Planetary Conjunction now! A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, \"13:00:03.\" The last seconds count down to, \"12:59:59!\" OCK (playing the computer) Okey, dokey. Now let\\'s see if I have enough power to drive this beast. He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER. INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT PETER is working on LIZ\\'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the whole assembly comes off in his hand. PETER (pulling Harry aside) I gotta remember to have that fixed. (opens the door) There you are, I\\'ve been looking for you all over town. HARRY What happened? PETER Where were you? HARRY I went to the wrestling, wanted to see that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn\\'t show up. PETER Listen, Harry something terrible happened. HARRY What? What? PETER My Planetary Conjunction papers... they were stolen... HARRY Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would do such a thing? PETER Ock... HARRY Of course... but why...? PETER We have to find out, sit down. (indicates computer) I want to access Dr. Octavius\\' main program. I want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron. Can you do it? HARRY (starts hacking) I can try. I could access the system in the dorm. Okay. And through that I could crack the main line. PETER Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the Octavius file... HARRY Okay, let\\'s try. HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking. PETER Yeah? JAMESON (V.O.) Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah Jameson! PETER (looking over Harry\\'s shoulder) Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time. JAMESON (V.O.) I need pictures of your friend, the Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots. We\\'re gonna pin that insect to the wall. Whaddaya say? PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON. INT. JAMESON\\'S OFFICE - NIGHT Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there. JAMESON What about that kid? On the job already? INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check- down. OCK Fusion cells...? All up. Internal temperature... okay. Risk? (a long beat) Acceptable. (another beat) Let\\'s fly. He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL goes to 90! INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each other and shrug. HARRY Got something! INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: \"06:00:03\" PETER What is it? HARRY Let me see. It\\'s some kind of countdown clock. PETER Countdown to what? HARRY I don\\'t know, but whatever it is, it\\'s only six hours away. PETER The Planetary Conjunction? HARRY Could be... PETER Or Doc Ock\\'s end of the world experiment... Or both! HARRY Wait a minute. You\\'re not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight...? PETER You want to wait around till midnight to find out? HARRY No, but... PETER Let\\'s see what else we\\'ve got. Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS. HARRY What\\'s that? PETER It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force. HARRY That\\'s a lot of energy. What could generate power like that? PETER The closest you could come is the New York City Subway System. Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return. HARRY/PETER (together) We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!! INT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT ROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS. ROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them. He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against his chin. ROZ Plutonium... EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar WHINE. The \"WALK\" and \"DON\\'T WALK\" signs FLASH at the same time. BOY Make up your mind! The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The BOY looks at the GIRL. GIRL What\\'s going on? An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner. INT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT SPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now stunned by the show. EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes. WOMAN Oh my God! MAN Get back! Get back! EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing. INT. TRAIN - NIGHT PEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change angles. EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the SUBWAY entrance. The TRAIN sails through the air. EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of cyclotron generated Dali physics. EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be heard. EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come sags and ripples like it has melted and partially resolidified. WOMAN Henry!!! Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN or pry open the DOORS. WOMAN What are you doing here? Get out of here! Get out of here! EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and we see their POV. The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply \"embedded\" in the HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR. INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT The car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and pound for help. ROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN. EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means. WOMAN It\\'s Spider-Man! TRUCK DRIVER #1 Get outa here, you bum! WOMAN Hey, what are you talking about?! TRUCK DRIVER #2 (back at woman) What\\'s the matter, lady don\\'t you read the papers? This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the historically famous Bugle headline, \"Spider-Man - Threat or Menace?\" MAN Go Spidey! Go! INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT It\\'s nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other. The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He nearly falls! The SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams again anyway. ROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward and out the OPEN DOOR. INSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down, and down... INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT SPIDEY\\'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down. SPIDER-MAN Hello, everybody... He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He feels it. SPIDER-MAN Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool. He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder. WOMAN (whining) Is that the real Spider-Man? SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it. SPIDER-MAN Somebody wanna give me a hand with this? First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions on the BATTERING RAM. SPIDER-MAN On three. One... Two... Three! They ram the GLASS and it shatters. INT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT HENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom as they all come rushing through into the room. HENRY Come on. Come on. That\\'s it. Step lively now. WIFE Henry, the rugs! HENRY Oh, shut up! SPIDER-MAN Have a nice evening, Ma\\'am... and you too, Henry. EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER. INT. THE LAST CAR - NIGHT SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams. SPIDER-MAN Okay, folks, just hang on... He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below. FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS. SPIDER-MAN Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma\\'am... A FAT WOMAN makes a \"who me?\" gesture. SPIDEY throws her over his shoulder. INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right angles begins to bend open. SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the MIDDLE CAR. INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more. SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks down. She screams. She steps across. EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of where it\\'s aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN stands at its apex. FIREMAN (into walkie) Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder! WALKIE Negative on that, you\\'re at full extension! INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings to a POLE. INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there from memory! ROZ This is Doctor Otto Octavius\\' work. I must get back to my university. I must stop Ock... he\\'s gone crazy. Can you help me? SPIDER-MAN Sure thing, just don\\'t take the train. Come on... give me your hand. ROZ Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this with the train, if he\\'s come this far, then I can pretty well predict his next step. He\\'ll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be stopped... or else he\\'ll destroy our world. The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches. SPIDER-MAN Let\\'s get you out of here first, Professor. ROZ Wait Spider-Man. I don\\'t think I can make it... You mustn\\'t waste time saving me... you must save the world! You must go and stop Ock! SPIDER-MAN Where can I find him...? ROZ He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I\\'m sure... The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR. SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ\\'S waist. SPIDER-MAN Think Rosomorf, think where one can find Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...? EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB. ROZ shouts. ROZ (shouting) There\\'s only one place he can get the Plutonium SL 270... SPIDER-MAN Where...? ROZ Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump would have SL 270. SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in the doorway, manipulating the WEB. The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the street below. EXT. STREET - NIGHT COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We hold several beats on the incredible rubble. Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself from the wreckage. COP (V.O.) Put your hands up, Spider-Man. SPIDER-MAN You\\'re making a big mistake. COP And you\\'re looking at twenty years. SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP\\'S GUN and leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet and falls limp. COP What the hell! EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is groggy and weak. He can\\'t think. He can\\'t focus. He can barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent. SPIDER-MAN Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270 Plutonium... must get that crazy old loony... before he gets to the Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the toxic dumps...? He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely. INT. AUNT MAY\\'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT LIZ is standing. AUNT MAY is seated on the COUCH, she looks weak, pale and alone. AUNT MAY You\\'re as lovely as Peter said you were. LIZ (embarrassed) Thank you. He really wanted so badly to come see you. He called me up out of the blue. AUNT MAY (great concern) Tell me about Peter. What\\'s he been up to? He seems so preoccupied. LIZ Oh, you know Peter... he\\'s all caught up in some kind of study he\\'s doing. Things are really crazy at the university now. Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess Peter\\'s just... well, you know... pulled into his shell. AUNT MAY (reminiscing) When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In the closets. Under the sink. He always needed a secret place. But when I\\'d look for him, he\\'d always laugh... he wanted to be found. LIZ Yeah... well. I don\\'t think he wants me to find him... Well, I\\'d better be going. My friend Flash is picking me up. AUNT MAY This Flash... he isn\\'t your boyfriend, is he? LIZ No... not really... I think you can guess why... They smile knowingly at each other. LIZ goes toward the DOOR. AUNT MAY Elizabeth...? She turns. AUNT MAY Finders keepers, losers weepers. LIZ What? AUNT MAY That\\'s what I used to say to Peter when I found him. EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy who\\'s making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a traffic jam below. SPIDER-MAN Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic dumps. (grabs his head) Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah! He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR. INT. GREEN CAR - NIGHT OCK is honking the HORN. Something lands on his ROOF. Then SPIDEY sticks his head, upside down, in the windshield. SPIDER-MAN What\\'s up, Ock? OCK You!!! A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY. OCK leaps from the CAR. OCK (on the run) You\\'re a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I\\'ve no time to waste on you now. EXT. STREET - NIGHT OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from CAR to CAR. OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb. OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls his GUN. FEMALE COP (gun poised) Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall and spread \\'em OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints. The little FEMALE COP\\'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from her hand. He starts to choke her. SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF nearby. SPIDER-MAN Hey, you big OCK, why don\\'t you pick on someone your own size?! OCK Alright Spider-Bug... here I\\'ve come for you... OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley. SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase. OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it with a WALDO. SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away. A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and is whipped away. He crawls over to the WINDOW. SPIDER-MAN Hey, driver. Could you follow that red Vette for me? The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures. SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up a WEB and swings away. SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a blue MG with its top up. SPIDER-MAN (swinging) Flash Thompson... I never thought I\\'d be happy to see you. EXT. BLUE MG - NIGHT SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG. INT. BLUE MG - NIGHT SPIDEY wedges down into the car, right between FLASH and LIZ. She WHOOPS. FLASH is thrilled. SPIDER-MAN Sorry about that! FLASH Spider-man! This is unbelievable...! SPIDER-MAN Flash, I need your help. FLASH You got it. SPIDER-MAN You any good with this thing? FLASH I\\'m the best. SPIDER-MAN Okay... catch that Vette! FLASH Roger, wilco, over and out. He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod. EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG CARS and begin falling apart. On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE looms ahead. The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK stuck in traffic. FLASH Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is it in that shitty red car... LIZ Don\\'t you recognize him... it\\'s Ock! SPIDER-MAN New Jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world. FLASH What does he want with toxic waste? SPIDER-MAN He\\'s looking for Plutonium, my dear... The car has to slow down... it\\'s in a traffic jam. FLASH Sorry... can\\'t do anything about this traffic. SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car. SPIDER-MAN Try to stay with me. I don\\'t want to lose him! Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes it across. The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN. He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It says, \"DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!\" SPIDER-MAN Bingo. INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by \"safety lights.\" VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK. INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one marked, \"HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!\" OCK Okey, dokey... SPIDER-MAN Open that now, and you\\'ll spoil Christmas. SPIDEY\\'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF. OCK Insect! I am going to squash you to death... Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones... OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the door with his SL 270. EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO. SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror. With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing. EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT OCK\\'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN\\'S neck as the WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy SPIDEY down the WELL. OCK Goodbye, Spider-Man! INT. THE WELL - NIGHT SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS. SPIDER-MAN Noooooooooooooo! He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at the starry sky. SPIDER-MAN (to himself) Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it. He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down. SPIDER-MAN (to himself) Don\\'t give up, Spidey. Don\\'t give up. The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO. Then it hisses, empty! SPIDER-MAN Empty... now what do I do? OCK So you\\'ve avoided the nuclear pool, have you, Spider-Man? SPIDER-MAN Well, so far so good. But I can\\'t hold on much longer. OCK Pity...! SPIDER-MAN Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let\\'s talk this over face to face... throw me a line... SPIDEY reaches out. OCK Okay... face to face... Catch this! OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS. He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN... FLASH Don\\'t do it, Professor! We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG. OCK (puts down the drum) I know you... and you, young lady. Both of you are in my physic class, aren\\'t you...? Come... you can help me. I need to get some of these drums to my laboratory... help me... and I\\'ll give you special grades. What\\'d you say? Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH. LIZ Leave him alone!!! Another WALDO grabs her. ROZ now appears on the scene. ROZ Leave them alone Otto! OCK But, they won\\'t help me. Everybody is trying to destroy my experiment. And so are you, Rosomorf. Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm. ROZ Otto... I was wrong. I\\'ve gone over your research. It\\'s brilliant, Otto. It\\'s mad, but it\\'s brilliant. You have much work left to do. I want to help you, Otto. For the sake of science, go and do your experiment. Leave... these kids alone and I\\'ll help you. OCK You will? You too? Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK gestures to FLASH and LIZ. OCK Help me with these drums, I need to get them to my laboratory immediately. ROZ Do as he says. OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR. OCK Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl right down the toilet! SPIDER-MAN Professor Rosomorf, it\\'s no good, double dealing... why did you help him...? ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well. ROZ Don\\'t lose your energy screaming. Catch this rope and climb up, come on! INT. ROZ\\'S CAR - NIGHT They drive along the highway. SPIDEY is recovering, working his neck. ROZ I\\'ve been through the Octavius data. He has enough power with his Plutonium. Especially if he gets his hands on Parker\\'s data, there he has enough power to do what he wants to do. And we are not going to stop him in time before the Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight... SPIDER-MAN Stop the car. I have an idea. They\\'re in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH is coming up on the right. INSERT: ROZ\\'S foot stabs the BRAKE. INT. ROZ\\'S CAR - NIGHT SPIDEY gets out of the car. Then he pats himself where his pockets ought to be. SPIDER-MAN Do you have a dime? INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT HARRY is there, working on the COMPUTER, PHONE RINGS, HARRY picks up. PETER Harry?! HARRY Peter, where are you? INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN Listen, Harry. You must get my paper before Ock uses it... INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT HARRY Your Planetary Conjunction data? It\\'s too late... Ock\\'s got your paper, it\\'s in his computer already. INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN, EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN. HARRY But don\\'t worry... he can never use it without Plutonium. SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) He\\'s got the Plutonium, and he\\'s on his way back to the lab! And he\\'s got two prisoners with him... Liz and Flash! HARRY Don\\'t worry... he needs a huge amount of power... thousands of volts of electricity... to get to the Anti-Force. SPIDER-MAN He can get to the power. Electrical power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL 270. And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock\\'s final power source. HARRY Damn... the Conjunction is due at midnight! What are we going to do? EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself... Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder. OCK Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones... for the last time. OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR. LIZ (still ministering) What do we do now? FLASH We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right, all there is left to do is... LIZ Wait... I think I can release my right hand... INT. PETER PARKER\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT HARRY How much time is left? Wait... I can find out... my God... 59 minutes! INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN The only way we can interfere with Ock\\'s plan is to find a computer center... fast. HARRY (V.O.) Our University has the biggest center in town. SPIDER-MAN Yeah, but who\\'s gonna work \\'em? EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS. HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school grounds. HARRY I think I can get some help... I can teach anyone how to work a code in five minutes. SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Then do it! INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks over LIZ\\'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her SCREEN reads out, \"CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line Backlog, Security Max Level.\" The last line is FLASHING. KIM Hey, this is easy. They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER. FLASH Hey, Harry I need help. HARRY Coming! HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. \"01:00:02\" becomes \"00:59:59\" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER! KIM I got one! I got one! LIZ Harry! Get over here! HARRY hurries to KIM\\'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing \"WARNING, Security Breach!\" HARRY\\'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend \"H20\". HARRY A goddamn water leak... FLASH Hey, look at this. Empire State University. This is our cyclotron, right? HARRY (serious) What does it say? FLASH (hits two keys) It says \"no information on net.\" HARRY Damn... we can\\'t do it... KIM You mean... we can\\'t stop loony Ock... HARRY I mean the world is in danger... FLASH We must find Peter, he knows these computers better than all of us. HARRY Yes, but where the hell is he? LIZ (mysteriously) I bet he is with Spider-Man... Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake. EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of the CONJUNCTION. EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING) come out running from the building beneath an enormous HANGING MOON. They are frightened. Suddenly it all stops. It\\'s quiet, the kids look at the sky. LIZ Look at the moon... I have never seen it so big. FLASH What is that... HARRY Must be the sun. We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out of their wits. EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT Suddenly from OCK\\'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn\\'t know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the UNIVERSITY. INT. ROZ\\'S CAR - NIGHT ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES. SPIDER-MAN It\\'s started. Step on it Professor, or we\\'ll never make it. They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming out of the SCIENCE CENTER. ROZ Our campus... right there... see those beams from Ock\\'s lab. We\\'re late... it\\'s coming... the Conjunction will happen in a few seconds. SPIDER-MAN massages his arm. SPIDER-MAN Stop the car...! Come with me. ROZ Where...? What...? SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL BUILDING taking ROZ with him. INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in through a WINDOW that\\'s been melted out. He is lost in a mad rapture. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER! SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:08:18\". OCK (looking back, madly) Aha! You never included the Conjunction in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf! ROZ Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to... all the patterns, all the harmonies... everything will be destroyed. OCK A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my destiny!!! ROZ It is cosmic suicide! You have no right! ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the \"BULLET\" but the WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN. ROZ You have to stop him... Spider-Man you have to stop him. SPIDER-MAN I\\'m afraid we\\'re too late. SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:06:48\". We are at 96% POWER! EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from the CENTER. LIZ He\\'s in there. I know Peter is in there. She breaks into a run. FLASH Liz, don\\'t... Liz come back... come back! LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them. INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is brewing! OCK Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has started. My Anti-Force is on! History is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf cheer up friends... we\\'re on our way to the unknown cosmos... we three are about to visit heaven... real Gods heaven. ROZ (sees the sky through the window) Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It\\'s happening! EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT The CONJUNCTION is now happening. INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly. INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the ceiling. LIZ Peter! Peter, where are you?! INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT OCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER. Cacophony! The \"BULLET\" begins to PULSE and THROB! The DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:05:58\". EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER. FLASH starts to run to the building. FLASH (screaming) Liz! Liz come on out! They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall of STONE and DIRT, six feet high. HARRY Get back! Flash... get back! FLASH Wow...! Then the building lurches upward again! This time it pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK. INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT LIZ opens a door. LIZ Peter! The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL where she crashes through another door. INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT All manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and screams against the Anti-Force. EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of ELECTRICITY directly at the building. INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT LIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath her, now a hundred feet below. And they\\'re still rising! FLASH and HARRY look up. FLASH Oh my God... Liz is inside there! HARRY And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock. FLASH What about Peter? Is he there with them? HARRY No, but I bet Spider-Man is. EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI. MAX That\\'s some show... if ever I saw one. INT. JAMESON\\'S OFFICE - NIGHT He\\'s looking out his window seeing the University\\'s Lab Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky. JAMESON (shouting) Tear out the front page! Change the headline... The biggest news is happening right now... we need photos... a camera... get me a camera...! EXT. SKY - NIGHT A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the CLOUDS. INT. AUNT MAY\\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT She pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER rise. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT OCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of SPARKS. He glances at the \"BULLET\" which now PULSES. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at \"00:04:18\". ROZ Where is it going Otto? OCK Other worlds, Roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? Who cares? ROZ Then... why? OCK Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The new way! SPIDER-MAN Don\\'t listen to him Professor Roz. OCK No, you don\\'t listen to that clown, he can\\'t save you, or the world for that matter. A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE). We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly... OCK Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and for all we\\'ll end the legend of your powers. OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO. OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that\\'s been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY. We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes flying in with the FIRE AXE. ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury! OCK (ultimate betrayal) You!! You were my teacher!!! ROZ doesn\\'t even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge of the HOLE and he\\'s shaking SPIDEY furiously. OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again. OCK You were my teacher! And you want to destroy my experiment. You are a scientist for heaven sake... don\\'t you want to know what\\'s up there? ROZ Yes, but not on account of our world. We have only one world... only one life. The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and falls through. SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into the dark. ROZ (calling back from the dark skies) Spider-Man! Only you can save us now... SPIDER-MAN Roz!!! (turns to Ock) Murderer!!! OCK Forget that old fool, insect. My Spider-Man... Come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven. EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK The PLANETS are virtually in line! INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT LIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She slams on the brakes and runs the other way. LIZ Peter! Peter! INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, \"00:02:59\". OCK throws the POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK, still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE. SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick! OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through the hole in the floor. EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION. OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY\\'S dilemma, hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes down and CLIPS the WEB. But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he can\\'t get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out. OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely. OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail. The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER- MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE. SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off, brandishing it like a broad sword. SPIDER-MAN Let\\'s have it, old boy! A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold, from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET. Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life! SPIDER-MAN Liz!! OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE. SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE. SPIDER-MAN Come on. LIZ Where\\'s Peter? He must be here somewhere. SPIDER-MAN (pulling her ahead) He\\'s around, don\\'t worry... we\\'ll find him. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, \"00:01:00\" as SPIDEY comes flying in with LIZ in tow. LIZ This building is flying. I\\'m in a goddamn flying building... SPIDER-MAN I think we have to pull some of these cables. Try those over there. I\\'ll work on these. We gotta slow this thing down somehow. We got helicopters coming. LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching it. SPIDER-MAN Pull! She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself. EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:00:15\" as SPIDEY and LIZ continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid. LIZ Oh my God... A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER THROTTLE. SPIDER-MAN The power! LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at \"00:00:10\". LIZ leaps and tries to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the CONSOLE. She holds on. \"00:00:03\". The WALDO crashes LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! \"00:00:01!\" SPIDER-MAN can\\'t break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED POWER THROTTLE! OCK Spider-Man. You\\'re end is coming. Life in its present form is ending... new dimensions, new horizons... The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a rushing ENERGY FLOW that\\'s pulling everything in the room towards the POINT of LIGHT. LIZ (bracing against the storm) What is happening? SPIDER-MAN (similarly braced) I don\\'t know!!! LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles against it. LIZ I can\\'t... hold on! SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB. SPIDER-MAN Hold tight, Liz, hold tight! OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT. OCK (spaced out) You cut my power... there\\'s too little power... It\\'s so tiny... so tiny... there\\'s only space... for me. But I\\'ve done it, Spider-Man. I have broken through... I\\'ve broken through! LIZ Don\\'t do it, Dr. Octavius! OCK Okey... dokey... Now that\\'s what I call an experiment!!! As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it. He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT. SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. They\\'re safe. Except for the fact that they\\'re in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city! EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER begins to drop in PULSING SURGES. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT SPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK disappeared. SPIDER-MAN I can\\'t control her. She\\'s dropping too fast! Alright... let\\'s go! LIZ But what about Peter? We\\'ve got to find Peter! SPIDER-MAN Peter will be okay, I promise you... Let\\'s go before it\\'s too late. (he grabs her) LIZ Go where? EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the cavalry. INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Trying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze of PIPES. SPIDER-MAN Maybe there\\'s another way... A HUGE CRACK opens above them. LIZ It\\'s breaking apart! SPIDER-MAN Alright, keep moving, a step at a time! They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000 feet below. LIZ We have to go back. SPIDER-MAN We can\\'t go back. He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ. LIZ Forget it... SPIDER-MAN Okay, have it your way. He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze. LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN, furious. LIZ (shouting across) What am I supposed to do with this! SPIDER-MAN (shouting back) Go ahead. It\\'s easier than it looks! We\\'ve got to try the fire escape. LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on the LEDGE. She does a comic \"phew\" and the LEDGE buckles beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the door, but it\\'s stuck. LIZ The door is stuck. SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR open. EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building. New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS look across at each other, helpless. EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT It drops like a stone. EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL. SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then disappears over the edge. LIZ screams! LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS. She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB END. A long, long beat. PETER (V.O.) Liz, Up here! LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ grabs it. She begins to climb. INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT PETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for an embrace. PETER Come on. I\\'ve found a way down. LIZ (at long last, love) I knew you were going to say that. They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit. INT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT This is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has turned on the lights. He\\'s got a handful of ROPE. LIZ Where\\'s the way out? PETER Right there! We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG. PETER Come on, help me with this. EXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE & BLUE. PETER Okay, stand still. He ties some ROPE around her waist. LIZ Is this going to work? PETER How do I know? LIZ I just adore confidence in a man. PETER Come on... They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL PARK is still a couple thousand feet down. LIZ What is it you say when you jump? PETER Your prayers. They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They reach out for each other but their hands don\\'t quite reach. Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks between them. EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of debris shoots upward. EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down into the frame lit by its wonderful light. The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute. They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below. They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The wind billows LIZ\\'S skirt and plays with PETER\\'S hair, and snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG. LIZ We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man for. PETER Somehow, I don\\'t think we\\'ve seen the last of him. LIZ Peter...! Finders, keepers... PETER What...? What is it? Why do you look like that? LIZ I think I\\'m in love. PETER (even his eyes blush) You are... LIZ With your friend... PETER Spider-Man? You\\'re in love with Spider-Man? LIZ I am... you think we\\'ll see him again? PETER We might... you never know. He kisses her. LIZ Oh. (bittersweet) This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know? PETER Nah. They land in the center of the park under the parachute. They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away. THE END',\n",

TITLE OVER: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001          We listen to fragments from a number of these calls...starting          with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the          caller\\'s grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the          situation is hopeless, that they are about to die.                         CUT TO:          TITLE OVER: TWO YEARS LATER          INT. BLACK SITE - INTERROGATION ROOM                         DANIEL          I own you, Ammar. You belong to me.          Look at me.          This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA\\'s man in Islamabad - a big          American, late 30\\'s, with a long, anarchical beard snaking          down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary          hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          (explaining the rules)          If you don\\'t look at me when I talk          to you, I hurt you. If you step off          this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to          me, I\\'m gonna hurt you. Now, Look          at me.          His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded          by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks.          Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching          and kicking.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Look at me, Ammar.          Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take          part in the beating.                                                                                                              2.          EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER          Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation          room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we          see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties.          She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin          and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core          that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is          MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first          overseas assignment.                         DANIEL          (to the guard)          Are we gonna board up these windows          or what?                         (TO MAYA)          Just off the plane from Washington,          you\\'re rocking your best suit for          your first interrogation, and then          you get this guy. It\\'s not always          this intense.                         MAYA          I\\'m fine.          She\\'s not.                         DANIEL          Just so you know, it\\'s going to take          awhile. He has to learn how helpless          he is. Let\\'s get a coffee.                         MAYA          No, we should go back in.          Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes          Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation          room.                         DANIEL          You know, there\\'s no shame if you          wanna watch from the monitor.          She shakes her head.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Alright.          At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          You might want to put this on.                                                                                                              3.                         MAYA          You\\'re not wearing one. Is he ever          getting out?                         DANIEL          Never.                         CUT TO:          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER          SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION          Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes.          Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of          what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is          on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She          looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water          on the floor.                         DANIEL          Right now, this is about you coming          to terms with your situation. It\\'s          you and me, bro. I want you to          understand that I know you, that          I\\'ve been studying you for a very          long time. I could have had you          killed Karachi. But I let you live          so you and I could talk.                         AMMAR                         (RESISTANT)          You beat me when my hands are tied.          I won\\'t talk to you.                         DANIEL          Life isn\\'t always fair, my friend.          Did you really think that when we          got you, I\\'d be a nice fucking guy?                         AMMAR          You\\'re a mid-level guy. You\\'re a          garbage man in a corporation. Why          should I respect you?                         DANIEL          And you\\'re a money man. A paperboy!          Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          A disgrace to humanity!                         (MORE)                                                                                                              4.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          You and your uncle murdered three          thousand innocent people. I have          your name on a five-thousand dollar          transfer via Western Union to a 9/11          hijacker.          He leans into Ammar\\'s ear. Uncomfortably close.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          And you got popped with 150 kilograms          of high explosives in your house!          AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!          And then Daniel smiles, laughs. Mercurial.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          I\\'m just fucking with you.          Beat. He laughs again.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          I don\\'t want to talk about 9/11.          What I want to focus on is the Saudi          group.          Daniel shows him a photo.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri.          And I know this dude is up to some          serious shit, and what I want from          you is his Saudi email.                         (PAUSE)          Feel free to jump in.                         (PAUSE)          Ammar, bro, I know that you know          this dude, just give me his          email...and I will give you a blanket.          I will give you a blanket and some          solid food.          No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          I know that you know him.                         AMMAR          I told you before, I won\\'t talk to          you.                         DANIEL          Have it your way.                         (MORE)                                                                                                              5.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          (to the masks)          Let\\'s go.          It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes          Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel          smothers Ammar\\'s face with a towel.          Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)                         (TO MAYA)          Grab the bucket.          Maya follows Daniel\\'s gesture to the corner of the room,          where there\\'s an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC          PITCHER.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Put some water in it.          She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          C\\'mon, let\\'s go.          The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings          the bucket back to Daniel.          Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar\\'s face, which is          now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef,          you guys met in Tunisia back in the          70s.                         AMMAR          (gasping for breath)          I don\\'t know, you asshole.          Maya shakes her head \"no.\"                         MAYA          That\\'s not credible.                         AMMAR                         (SCREAMING)          Why are you doing this to me?                         DANIEL          You\\'re a terrorist, that\\'s why I\\'m          doing it to you.                                                                                                              6.                         AMMAR          Fuck you.          Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar\\'s nose.                         DANIEL          I want emails of the rest of the          Saudi group. Give me emails of the          rest of the Saudi group! Give me          one email, and I will stop this!          Ammar doesn\\'t speak. He can\\'t.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Who\\'s in the Saudi group, and what\\'s          the target? Where was the last time          you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE          LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN?          Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar\\'s mouth:          and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for          air.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          This is what defeat looks like, bro.          Your jihad is over.          Daniel stands.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Get him up.          The guards bring Ammar to his feet.          Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar\\'s face          and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Try to understand the concept here.          I have time, you don\\'t. I have other          things to do, you don\\'t.                         (BEAT)          It\\'s cool that you\\'re strong. I          respect it, I do. But in the end,          everybody breaks, bro. It\\'s biology.          Dan and Maya exit.          They\\'ve learned nothing.                         CUT TO:          EXT.

BRADLEY          How did it go the other night?                         DANIEL          It was good. The local cops need          tactical help. But he\\'s Tier fucking          One, baby.

They walk towards her as Bradley considers          what Daniel is asking for.                                                                                                              8.

BRADLEY          How do you like Pakistan so far?

BRADLEY          You volunteered for this didn\\'t you?                         MAYA          No.          Bradley smiles. He knew she didn\\'t volunteer.          They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an          electronic door.

AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - CONFERENCE ROOM          A group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting,          chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table.                                                                                                              10.          We will get to know:          JACK, mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the          National Security Agency (NSA).          JESSICA, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in          the station who wears a skirt.                         JACK          Some dude tells the Malaysian station          that his nephew works with a guy who          knows a guy--                         JESSICA          Here we go.                         JACK          Hold on - He goes to a big feast in          Bangkok about a year ago. The guest          of honor? Usama bin Laden.          Laughter in the room.                         JACK (CONT\\'D)          So I say, was Tupac there too?                         JESSICA          Right, but you forgot - you forgot          Mullah Omar.          J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter:                         JEREMY                         (SARCASTICALLY)          This is worth 5 million bucks.          J.J.          You know we\\'re going to have to chase          it down.                         JEREMY          That\\'s me, man. No job too small.                         JACK          That\\'s why I have a gift for you, my          friend.          Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter,          a little late.                         DANIEL          Everyone, this is Maya. Maya,          everyone.

DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Please don\\'t ask how it\\'s going with          Ammar because she\\'s not going to          fucking tell you.                         JESSICA          Ammar is withholding?          Daniel nods.                         JESSICA (CONT\\'D)          (reading from her                         FILE)          Washington assesses that Abu Faraj          is officially our new number three -          JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions          Abu Faraj\\'s mugshot to number three in the line, two down          from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the          riffs continue -                         DANIEL          - Best man for it.          JACK (O.S.)          London station is already asking if          we think he\\'s in contact with anyone          in the U.K.                         JEREMY          Like we\\'re just keeping it from them.          Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.                         JESSICA          The Jordanians are being really          helpful with Ammar\\'s transit papers.          Jessica passes Daniel a file.                         DANIEL          Any imminent threats in here?                         JESSICA          They want the Consulate, the Marriott,          it\\'s low security. And they\\'ve got          Majid Kahn talking about gas stations          in the US.                         DANIEL          And that\\'s a conversation?          Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely          a conversation - not a fully realized plot.                                                                                                              12.                         JESSICA          Honestly? There are six hundred          questions in there. I\\'d concentrate          on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it          matter what Faraj thinks about          Heathrow? How much latitude does he          get to pick targets?                         DANIEL          I think he\\'ll give up the Saudis.          But Heathrow is gonna be tough.          Anyway. Anything from last night?          J.J.          Quetta base thinks they have a bead          on the Arabs that escaped, and they\\'re          going to meet with the ISI this          afternoon, hopefully to set up a          raid down there.                         DANIEL          Great.                         JEREMY          And Lahore reporting ISI down there          was painfully slow last night. Again.          I\\'m beginning to think it\\'s not          incompetence.                         DANIEL          I agree, I spoke to the Chief about          that. Anything on bin Laden?                         JESSICA          (reading from a cable)          A farmer on the Afghan border near          Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped          pattern in the hills, tall male in          the center of the diamond, flanked          by four guards. It\\'s consistent          with UBL\\'s movements.                         JEREMY          That\\'s supposed to be his royal guard?                         MAYA          That\\'s pre-9/11 behavior.          Jessica doesn\\'t appreciate the challenge.                         JESSICA                         (CHILLY)          We don\\'t have reason to believe he\\'s          changed security tactics.                                                                                                              13.                         MAYA          We invaded Afghanistan. That\\'s a          reason.          And so the rivalry begins.          J.J.          Hey, boss, I got a guy for five          thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi          stand and snoop around a bit.                         DANIEL          No, don\\'t need him, the diamond          sighting is bullshit. See if the          Paks will send someone to talk to          the farmer. Anything else? We need          to be putting runs on the board          against Faraj. Speak to the case          officers who didn\\'t see fit to make          it today. And thank them.          INT. MAYA\\'S APARTMENT - ISLAMABAD          The loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from          the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch.                         CUT TO:          INT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON          Daniel and the guards enter Ammar\\'s cell with Maya. Daniel          switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar.                         DANIEL          Let\\'s take it easy today, huh?          Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of          falafel.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Hungry? The food in here sucks so I          got you some of this.          Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking          about him. The guy gets a bomb in          his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable.          You know him, don\\'t you?          Slowly, Ammar nods.                                                                                                              14.                         AMMAR          Yes.                         DANIEL          I\\'m glad you said that. I have an          email from you to him. I\\'ve had all          your coms for years, bro. Who else          is in your Saudi group?                         AMMAR          I just handed out some cash for them.          I didn\\'t know who the guys were.                         DANIEL          When you lie to me, I hurt you.                         AMMAR          Please.                         DANIEL          I believe you. I do, I believe you.          Beat.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Do you want the water again, or do          you want something else?                         AMMAR          Please.                         DANIEL          Just give me a name.                         AMMAR                         I DON\\'T--          Daniel jumps up.                         AMMAR (CONT\\'D)          I don\\'t know.          Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked          guards walk to the rope pulleys.                         DANIEL          You see how this works? You don\\'t          mind if my female colleague sees          your junk, do you?          Daniel pulls down Ammar\\'s pants. Maya flinches at the bare          nakedness.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Dude, you shit your pants.                                                                                                              15.          Daniel turns to Maya -                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          You stay here, I\\'ll be back.          Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the          naked, chained man.          Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his          eyes.                         AMMAR          Your friend is an animal. Please,          help me. Please.          A long beat.                         MAYA          You can help yourself by being          truthful.          The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel          was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a          DOG COLLAR in his hand.                         DANIEL          This is a dog collar.          Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his          neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation.          Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          You determine how I treat you.          Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          I\\'m going to walk you.          Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner          of the room, then leans down to address his victim:                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          What the fuck do you think is going          on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told          me that you know.          At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a          large wooden box resting on a platform.                                                                                                              16.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          This box sucks. I\\'m going to put          you in it.          Ammar tries to speak but can\\'t get a word out.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          When is the attack?                         AMMAR                         (VERY SOFTLY)          Sunday.                         DANIEL          Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday          or next Sunday?          Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.                         AMMAR          Monday.                         DANIEL          Is it Sunday or Monday?          Ammar doesn\\'t answer. The masked men approach.                         DANIEL (CONT\\'D)          Which day is it? Partial information          is treated as a lie.                         AMMAR          Saturday.          Beat. The masked men open the box.                         AMMAR (CONT\\'D)          Sunday!          The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He          shouts with his last reserve of energy:                         AMMAR (CONT\\'D)          Monday!                         DANIEL          Ammar, which day?                         AMMAR                         (MUMBLING)          Monday, Tuesday,          Beat.                                                                                                              17.                         AMMAR (CONT\\'D)          Thursday.          Beat.                         AMMAR (CONT\\'D)          Friday.          Daniel slams the box shut. Once again, he\\'s learned nothing.                         CUT TO:          EXT. KHOBAR TOWERS - SAUDI ARABIA - DAY          ECU: a magazine CLICKS into the receiver of a black assault          rifle.

This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in          Afghanistan and one of the CIA\\'s most important assets.          In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table.

HAKIM                         (TRANSLATING)          He carried messages from Faraj to          bin Laden and from bin Laden back to          Faraj.

(BEAT)          A lot of them say that after 9/11,          he went to work for KSM.                         (BEAT)          When KSM got captured, he went to          work for Abu Faraj, primarily as a          courier from Faraj to bin Laden.                         BRADLEY          Well, that\\'s good.

Does bin Laden invite          him into the living room and hand          him a letter directly? Or is Abu          just the last guy in a long line of          couriers, so that\\'s why everybody          knows him?                                                                                                              28.

BRADLEY          Maybe. Detainees could withhold his          location for any number of reasons.          Perhaps they don\\'t know; perhaps          this Abu is just a cover story and          he\\'s really a fucking unicorn.

He          uses a cane.                         MAYA          Kind of like Gandolf?                         FARAJ          Who?                         MAYA          When was the last time you saw him?                         FARAJ          A month ago, in Karachi, but I don\\'t          know where he is now. Sometimes I          wouldn\\'t even see him, he would just          tell me where to leave the messages.                         MAYA          I don\\'t believe you.          The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj          across the face.          Faraj\\'s expression doesn\\'t change and Maya herself remains          flat and steady, unmoved by the violence.          She\\'s not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago.                                                                                                              36.

You determine how you are          treated, and your life will be very          uncomfortable until you give me          information I need.          The guard slaps Faraj again.

EXT. ISLAMABAD - NEAR THE MARRIOTT HOTEL - NIGHT          The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE.          The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate          is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the          window - shine their bright light right into Maya\\'s eyes.

Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him          defiantly. He advances forward a bit. She rolls up her          window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell          phone.          The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police          confer. The original policeman returns, this time with          several other cops. They knock on the glass. Hard.          Maya stares straight ahead.                         CUT TO:          INT.

MAYA          I can work on it at the same time -          plus I think it\\'s a good thing that          he lied.

MAYA (CONT\\'D)                         (BEAT)          It\\'s a good thing because the fact          that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is          revealing. The only other thing he          lied about was the location of bin          Laden himself. That means Faraj          thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to          protect as bin Laden. That confirms          my lead.                         JESSICA          Or it\\'s confirmation bias.                         (BEAT)          We\\'re all just worried about you,          okay?

But Al Qaeda needs doctors          and they are short staffed and that          could explain his rise.

He was one of ten names          on a watch list sent to us by the          Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed.          They told us to watch out for him,          apparently they think his whole family          and extended family is bad and has          ties to KSM.

DEBBIE          Nobody saw it, most likely. There          was a lot of white noise after 9/11,          countries wanting to help out, we          got millions of tips and...

So doesn\\'t that          make him a little less interesting          to you?          MAYA O.S.          He may not be. We now know that Abu          Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All          the brothers in the family look alike.          Three of them went to Afghanistan.          Isn\\'t it possible that when the three          eldest brothers grew beards in          Afghanistan, they started to look          alike? I think the one calling          himself Abu Ahmed is still alive.          The picture we\\'ve been using is wrong.          It\\'s of his older brother, Habeeb.          He\\'s the one that\\'s is dead.                         DANIEL          Okay, what are you basing this on?          INT.

Plus, the detainee          said that Habeeb died in 2001. We          know that Abu Ahmed was alive then,          trying to get into Tora Bora with          Ammar. That means it\\'s probably one          of the other brothers that\\'s dead.          DANIEL O.S.          In other words, you want it to be          true.

(looks at his watch,                         INTO PHONE)          When can we grab lunch?          He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn\\'t          gonna wait.                         MAYA          I need a picket line along the GT          highway and men spaced at intervals          along the road and at every exit.                                                                                                              71.                         ALEXANDER          Maya, I know -                         MAYA          So you agree with me now. This is          important?                         ALEXANDER          No, I\\'ve just learned from my          predecessor that life is better when          I don\\'t disagree with you.                         CUT TO:          EXT. GRAND TRUNK ROAD - PAKISTAN - DAY          A two lane highway. Tucked on the side of the road is an          OLD MAN with a cart of mangoes.          MAYA (V.O.)          Our current hypothesis is that he          lives somewhere along the highway,          in one of the towns, or a medium          sized city called Abbottabod, or up          near Kashmir.          ECU: mango cart. Nestled among the fruit is a BLACK RADIO.          EXT. FARTHER DOWN GRAND TRUCK ROAD/HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS          Squatting in the dirt near a bus stop is another OLD MAN,          watching passengers disembark from a bus.          MAYA (V.O.)          Kashmir is interesting because it\\'s          a way station for the Tribals.          We stay with the old man for a while.          At last, the white POTAHAR SUV drives past. He makes a note          in his pad.                         CUT TO:          EXT. HIGHWAY - MAJOR EXIT - DAY          A nut seller, another CIA look out, scoops a handful of nuts          into a bag for a CUSTOMER as he keeps an eye on CARS exiting          the highway.          He takes note as the white POTAHAR passes him.                                                                                                              72.          MAYA (V.O.)          Abbottabod is interesting because we          know from detainee reporting that          Faraj stayed there, briefly in 2003.                         CUT TO:          EXT. PAKISTANI STREET - DAY          The street is filled with compact cars.          MAYA (V.O.)          The good news is he\\'s driving a white          SUV. SUV\\'s are actually pretty rare          in Pakistan. If he was driving a          sedan or a compact, we\\'d be fucked.                         CUT TO:          INT.

MAYA          Good morning, Amad.          Maya gets in her car. The gate opens. As she starts pulling          out onto the street, suddenly a car drives up in front of          her and THREE SHOOTERS come out and hammer Maya\\'s Toyota.          INT.

Next time there might not be          bulletproof glass to save you.                         MAYA          Yeah.                         ALEXANDER          And you, of all people, should know          that once you are on their list, you          never get off.

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - ABBOTTABAD, PAKISTAN - DAY          Hakim paces on a street as the POTAHAR we\\'ve been following          drives past him. Hakim watches the vehicle enter a gated          COMPOUND.                         CUT TO:          INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS PREDATOR BAY - LANGLEY - EVENING          The Langley Predator Bay is an impressive sight, a command          center bristling with high-tech equipment. The room is filled          with TECHNICIANS. George is in the center, where he belongs,          directing traffic. People come up and give him new pieces          of information.          The big screen displays a single image:          The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod.                                                                                                              74.          SUPERIMPOSE: PREDATOR BAY - CIA HEADQUARTERS          From the back of the room, Maya enters, and watches the          activity unfold without her... without her input.          George notices her, gives a thumbs up and then turns back to          his troops.          STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George\\'s top          deputies, joins Maya.                         STEVE          Basically we had a guy who rolled          with Al Qaeda and did services for          them. We lost him for seven years          and now we found him again -- and          boy does he have a really nice house.          Is that it?                         MAYA          Pretty much.                         STEVE          Okay, let\\'s go talk to the boss.                         CUT TO:          INT. LANGLEY BRIEFING ROOM          Maya and Steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled          conference room.          A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center          of the conference table, right next to a poster-sized          satellite image of the compound.          She starts to sit in one of the chairs.                         STEVE                         (GENTLE)          You should sit back there...sorry.          Steve points her to the back of the room.                         STEVE (CONT\\'D)          They\\'re gonna ask: if bin Laden is          at the end of this rainbow - is the          Pak military with him?                         MAYA          The question isn\\'t are the Paks          protecting bin Laden?\\'                         (MORE)                                                                                                              75.                         MAYA (CONT\\'D)          The question is, \\'would he allow          himself to be protected by the Paks?\\'          I mean, why would he trust them? He          tried to kill Musharaf.          Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing          in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR          enter the room, he clears the head of the table.                         CIA DIRECTOR          Go ahead.                         STEVE          If you take a right out of Islamabad          and drive about forty-five minutes          North, you\\'ll find yourself here in          Abbottabad. A middle class community -          some ex-military - not particularly          interesting to us. Except we did          find this compound, which is unique.          We got a sixteen foot wall around          the entire perimeter, the windows          are blacked out. It\\'s a fortress.                         CIA DIRECTOR          Can\\'t you put a camera somewhere -          in the trees - to get a look into          the main house?                         GEORGE          It will probably be discovered.                         CIA DIRECTOR          We have to get a look into the house.          The Director moves to the satellite image.          CIA DIRECTOR (CONT\\'D)          Alright, what\\'s this? This cluster          of buildings down here.                         GEORGE          The PMA - The Pakistan Military          Academy. It\\'s their West Point.                         CIA DIRECTOR          And how close is that to the house?                         GEORGE          About a mile.

MAYA          I\\'m the motherfucker that found this          place, Sir.          The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the          model.                         CIA DIRECTOR          I want to know more about who\\'s inside          this house by the end of the week.          The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.

CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY - NIGHT          We see a drone-fed overhead IMAGE of the bin Laden house in          real time with a resolution of 100 feet. Maya stares at the          screen, trying to decipher the shapes moving beneath her,          thousands of miles away.                                                                                                              77.

We\\'ve got two males, two females,          and seven kids.          Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard.                         MAYA          Who\\'s that?

(POINTING AGAIN)          You can see their height relative to          this - these are cows - so they\\'re          probably between seven and nine.          Boys.          Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes-          line and grabs some laundry.                         MAYA          Your female is moving fast.

GEORGE          Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer.          You give up your hope right now. We          scanned for heat signatures, but we          can\\'t validate if it\\'s a man or a          woman up there.

GEORGE          We talked about burrowing a pin hole          camera but there\\'s a high risk of          discovery.                         (MORE)                                                                                                              80.                         GEORGE (CONT\\'D)          We have explored the possibility of          digging tunnels, of sending hot air          balloons, of re-routing supply C-          130\\'s to take a peek, but that might          be too alerting. We\\'ve looked for          ways of collecting available DNA          from his trash - you know, looking          for his toothbrush, but they burn          the trash. We started a vaccination          program, we sent a doctor to the          house, to see if he could pull blood.          A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the          doctor away.                         GEORGE (CONT\\'D)          That didn\\'t work out. We thought          about sending a guy with a bucket to          pull a sample from the sewer to          analyze his fecal matter.          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR          What was wrong with that, exactly?          He looks up.                         GEORGE          What was wrong with that? The sample          would be too diluted.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          And it\\'s asking too much to get a          voice confirmation with him on the          phone?                         GEORGE          They don\\'t make telephone calls from          the compound. We pulled the cell          tower nearby.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          And I\\'m also going to give up hope          that he might ever get in that white          SUV and drive around a bit and we          could see him? Don\\'t they get          groceries.                         GEORGE          The unidentified third male does not          get groceries. He does not leave          the compound. He does not present          himself for photographs.

GEORGE (CONT\\'D)          When he needs fresh air, he paces          around beneath a grape arbor, but          the leaves are so thick they obscure          our satellite views. This is a          professional attempt to avoid          detection - real tradecraft. The          only people we\\'ve seen behave this          way are other top level Al Qaeda          operatives.          The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant          who slides a big folder across his desk to George.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          We did a Red Team on your analysis.          According to them, this behavior          could belong to someone other than          Al Qaeda.          DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          They did give a forty percent chance          that the unidentified third man is a          senior Al Qaeda operative. But they          also said there\\'s a thirty-five          percent chance he\\'s a Saudi drug                         DEALER          (reading from the                         BINDER)          A fifteen percent chance that he\\'s a          Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent          chance that he\\'s one of the relatives          of the brothers.          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR          Basically, we agree with you, the          house screams security, it screams          someone who wants privacy, it even          screams \\'bad guy\\', but it does not          scream bin Laden.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          You get the point.                         (BEAT)          If you can\\'t prove it\\'s bin Laden,          at least prove it\\'s not somebody          else, like a drug dealer.          Beat.          The meeting is adjourned.          As they walk out --                                                                                                              82.                         GEORGE          You know we lost our ability to prove          that when we lost the detainee          program.                         (BEAT)          Who the hell am I supposed to ask?          Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered          up? He\\'ll just tell his lawyer to          warn bin Laden.

GEORGE          He\\'d be the first successful drug          dealer never to have dealt drugs.          He has no internet access to the          house. He makes no phone calls either          in or out. Who\\'s he selling to,          who\\'s he buying from, how\\'s he making          his money? And if you\\'re going to          say he\\'s retired, I\\'d say where\\'s          his swimming pool, where\\'s the gold          cage with the falcons? And why does          he send his courier to the two cities          in Pakistan we most associate with          Al Qaeda, that have nothing          particularly to do with heroin          production?          The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently.                                                                                                              83.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          The President is a thoughtful,          analytical guy. He needs proof.                         CUT TO:          INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY          The National Security Advisor and his team file out. George          approaches.                         GEORGE          I have to admit, I just don\\'t get          the rhythms of politics.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          You think this is political? If          this was political we\\'d be having          this conversation in October when          there\\'s an election bump. This is          pure risk. Based on deductive          reasoning, inference, supposition          and the only human reporting you          have is six years old, from detainees          who are questioned under duress.          The political move here is to tell          you to go fuck yourself, and remind          you that I was in the room when your          old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least          there you guys brought photographs.                         GEORGE          You know, you\\'re right, I agree with          everything you just said. What I          meant was, a man in your position,          how do you evaluate the risk of not          doing something, the risk of          potentially letting bin Laden slip          through your fingers?          George shakes his head with an \"aww shucks\" kind of shake.                         GEORGE (CONT\\'D)          That is a fascinating question.          George walks away. After a beat, the National Security          advisor calls after him.          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR          Hey.          George turns around.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (CONT\\'D)          (lowering his voice)          I\\'m not saying we\\'re gonna do it.          But the President wants to know: if          we were going to act, how would we          do it? Give us options.                         CUT TO:          EXT.

This isn\\'t going          to be easy.                         MAYA          There are two narratives about the          location of Osama bin Laden.          This registers on the SEALs.                         MAYA (CONT\\'D)          The one that you\\'re most familiar          with is that UBL is hiding in a cave          in the Tribal Areas, that he\\'s          surrounded by a large contingent of          loyal fighters.          Beat.                         MAYA (CONT\\'D)          But that narrative is pre- 9/11          understanding of UBL.          The second narrative is that he\\'s          living in a city - living in a city          with multiple points of egress and          entries and with access to          communications so that he can keep          in touch with the organization. You          can\\'t run a global network of inter-          connected cells from a cave.          Beat.

And          we assess that one of the other          occupants of the house is UBL.                         JUSTIN          Excuse me. You got an intel source          on the ground?

Okay, so how do you know it\\'s          bin Laden? We\\'ve been on this op          before, you know.                         MAYA          Bin Laden uses a courier to interact          with the outside world. By locating          the courier, we\\'ve located bin Laden.

I wanted to drop a bomb but people          didn\\'t believe in this lead enough          to drop a bomb, so they\\'re using you          guys as canaries on the theory that          if bin Laden isn\\'t there, you can          sneak away and no one will be the          wiser.

CIA DIRECTOR          I\\'m about to go look the President          in the eye and what I\\'d like to know,          no fucking bullshit, is where everyone          stands on this thing. Now, very          simply. Is he there or is he not          fucking there?          He looks to the Deputy Director.                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR          We all come at this through the filter          of our own past experiences. I          remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I          fronted that and I can tell you the          case for that was much stronger than          this case.                                                                                                              88.

GEORGE          I\\'m at eighty percent. Their OPSEC          is what convinces me.                         CIA DIRECTOR          You guys ever agree on anything?                         DANIEL          Well, I agree with sixty, we\\'re basing          this mostly on detainee reporting          and I spent a bunch of time in those          rooms - who knows?

The          SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening          in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of          the prayer room.          EXT.

One skims Patrick\\'s          shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house,          putting a dozen rounds inside.          A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle          unlocks. ABU AHMED\\'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks          out.                         JARED          Ir-fah ee-dek!

He          goes to the gun and picks it up.          He hears his name again, \"Khaled!\" And the voice sounds          friendly, urgent.          Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled          puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and          heads back to the sound of his name.          Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the          stairway and fires - killing him instantly.          Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb          the staircase leading to the third floor.                         CUT TO:          EXT.

I must be frank, Your Majesty, there islittle chance the Senate will act on the invasion.AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little realpower...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. Amanufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.AMIDALA : What options do we have?PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a strongerSupreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforcesthe laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidencein Chancellor Valorum.AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to thecourts...AMIDALA : There\\'s no time for that. The courts take even longer to decidethings than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more eachday.

The weaponson your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.OBI-WAN : And there\\'s an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, YourHighness, he will return with another droid army.PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everythingdepends on it.INT.

Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.          BOWER (V.0.)          Where were you... when Eden was lost?          Like every other kid on my block, I was          in the middle of a dream, envious of          those who were chosen to be part of          mankind\\'s greatest quest. Dreaming of          the unknown and trying to imagine what          only the lucky few would encounter.           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...                          DISSOLVE THRU:          INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.          Inside the flight deck it\\'s ghostly vacant, rows of empty          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been          suddenly evacuated.          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.          BOWER.(V.0.)          As the entire world watched in wonder,          there were only a few, skeptical of the          journey\\'s success.                         (BEAT)          Only a few... who would be right.          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

CONTINUED:          CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...          heightening the trapped OFFICER\\'S muffled,. screams.                         TRAPPED OFFICER                         (IN FRENCH)          STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD\\'S SAKES! PLEASE!          GOD NO!          The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,          taking a breath of relief.                         TRAPPED OFFCIER                         (IN FRENCH)          STOP IT! YOU DON\\'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL          DO TO- YOU\\'RE NOT- STOP! YOU\\'RE GOING          TO FUCKING KILL US ALL!          The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.          TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)                         (IN FRENCH)          PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!          Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.

We\\'re suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a          bee hive that\\'s exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship          slowly continues its unaffected course.

OUTER SPACE          We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer          it\\'s the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.          BOWER (P.O.)          Where was I... when I heard we\\'d lost          Eden? Just like every other kid on my          block... I was dreaming... of being one          who would be chosen to follow.          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it\\'s          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...                         CUT TO:          M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER          A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.                         CUT TO:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

He gets to his feet,          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It\\'s          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into          his mouth as possible.          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It\\'s EMPTY.          The third pod\\'s name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn\\'t seem familiar.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Bower? Bower...?          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

Under the smear is...          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes          a fist with concern.                         CUT TO:          INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER          BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.                         BOWER          Bower.          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005¬ª015.          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.

EVALON, a          beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at          the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the          back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a          pocket and exits.

FLASH CUT          An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to          her, gripping her hands.          BOWER\\'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the          cup and... winces with disgust.                         BOWER          Faa-uck!          Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and          toward the sounds... PAYTON\\'S sleep chamber.          THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower          jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the          hatch bursting open. Out climbs...          PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a          man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair          cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the          floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You\\'re-          Sir... whoa!          PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once          over with a frown and a sobering tone.

PAYTON.                         BOWER          This is you, sir.                         PAYTON          How do you know that?                         BOWER          1 It\\'s... the name on your sleep pod, sir.          PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo          of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with          utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory          recovery card inside the locker.                         (CONTINUED)                                                                                                              10.

I guess when you gamma          the brain into extended REM, sometimes it          can take a while to get it back.          PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into          his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his          forearm, partially obscured from view;          FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his          own, PAYTON\\'S tattoo is faded with age.                         BOWER          I\\'ve been awake for at least an hour and          I still can\\'t remember my... anything.                         PAYTON          Listen, the last time I crawled out of a          hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while          to get it all back.          BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a          wedding ring.                         BOWER          What was... your last flight, sir?                         PAYTON                         (BEAT)          Don\\'t recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey?          Don\\'t worry, it\\'ll come back, eventually.          PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          I\\'ve gone through this before. I just          can\\'t remember why I would agree to do it          again.          PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a          serious tone.                         BOWER          Sir? I know this is going to sound          strange, but do you even know where we\\'re          going? I can remember the training,          but... not the mission. Know the          procedures, not the... destination.

For all I know          this was another damn training exercise-                         PAYTON          Trust me, it\\'s not. if this is a          simulation...          PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored          panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          Someone is taking the joke a little far.          He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight\\'s beam          panning away, taking us into darkness.                         CUT TO:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATER          BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the          screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee          and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.                         BOWER          None of the activators are working.                         PAYTON          Figures. We can ride two hundred          thousand tons of space freighter across          the galaxy without a dent in the hood,          but can\\'t get one good cup of coffee.          PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.                         BOWER          Without the mainframe, we can\\'t connect.          I don\\'t know how we\\'ll ever be able to-          PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open          an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle          and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of          whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of          electricity to the light panels.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Oh, I- didn\\'t even think of that.

Shit-                         BOWER          Five.                         PAYTON          Five? How do you know that?          BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON          nods, \"good thinking.\"                         PAYTON (CONT-D)          Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does          anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone          awake up there?          Dead static.                         BOWER          Team Four suppose to be here for the          shift rotation. Where could they be?                         PAYTON          Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn\\'t          get to us.          BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.                         BOWER          Where could he have gone?          PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass          and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.                         PAYTON          The power systems must be free-floating          off blown circuits or something. The          over-ride grid won\\'t even lock in.                         BOWER          Whatta ya think?                         PAYTON          I think we need to find a deck of cards          and call the union.          Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching          the ceiling with uncertainty.

That could          be anything.          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          I say we get out of here. I\\'d rather be          up and out then stuck in the trunk.          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          We\\'re not far from the bridge but without          the circuits locked in... I don\\'t know          how we could ever get this thing open.          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.                         BOWER          Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.                         PAYTON          Ironic. I think it was built to protect          us.                         BOWER          (gesturing to the third pod)          Well, he got out... some how.          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head          as it fades.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Cycle is broken.                         I                         PAYTON          What?                         BOWER          It\\'s not circuitry. Reactor timing is          off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but          it\\'s not. Each revolution decreasing          before starting over from the beginning.

PAYTON          Now if we only had a monkey and a rope.          PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.                         BOWER          Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this          way. Don\\'t you think?                         PAYTON          Must have.

In the midst of the wreckage, a          darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards,          angrily tossing empty containers aside.

His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out          anything hidden.

BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of          sharpened metal.          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat          and gargled CACKLES.          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,          following NADIA\\'S path.          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...          PAYTON (ON RADIO)          Is that you!?

WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into          black.          We hear...

I\\'m not gonna hurt you!          SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs          circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Hey? You with me? You\\'re gonna be          alright. Hear me?          Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices          BOWER\\'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He          begins to weep, tears of joy and agony.                         SHEPARD          Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector          Eight. I think I\\'m the only one, sir. I          knew it.

SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the          corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a          screwdriver into his hand.

SHEPARD begins to tremble, backing away. BOWER sets his jaw,          stepping out into the corridor and slowly cranks the power-          lever... with a WHINE of magnetos, raising the weapon.

I CONTINUED : (5)          BOWER turns and runs, trying to follow SHEPARD as SHADOWED          HUNTERS move past the end of the corridor.                         CUT TO:          INT. FILTRATION COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER          BOWER has a difficult time trying to keep up as SHEPARD          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and          a maze of piping.          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and          CACKLES grow louder.          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.          I They exchange a look and SHEPARD angrily waves him away.                         SHEPARD                         (MOUTHING)          Don\\'t follow me! I can\\'t help you-          SHANK! A wire noose SNAPS tight around SHEPARD\\'S neck. Much          like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators, the wire          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild          frenzy, trying to run while on a thirty foot long leash. The          wire loops and tangles around the piping as...          HUNTERS move in from every direction, blades whirling.          SHEPARD\\'S SCREAM intensifies as the HUNTERS huddle over him.          BOWER viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and          climbs out of his hiding place as... SCREAMS intensify          within the brutal attack as the HUNTERS begin to feed.          SEEPARD\\'S neck is twisted far enough to SNAP!                         BOWER                         FUCKING BASTARDS-          I BOWER raises the gun towards the back of the lead hunter,          only fifteen feet away. He pulls the trigger and rusted          metal SCREECHES! Jammed.

CONTINUED:          He panics, grabbing the gun with both hands, checking for a          safety switch and... KA-WHAP! The weapon discharges a          tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side.          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic          material, but for safety precautions, it\\'s unable to          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It\\'s          unable to puncture the ship\\'s hull.          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing          packs a punch.          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to          reveal itself as...          } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He          squeezes the trigger and...          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,          searching for a route around the glass divider.          BOWER runs for his life.                         CUT TO:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.

Blades SCRAPE across metal, Blue.torches ROAR, HISSES echo.          BOWER gasps heavily, hyper-ventilating as he catches glimpses          of HUNTERS on his trail and running parallel in adjacent          corridors, closing in with unnatural agility and speed.

BOWER tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he FALLS          off the edge of a loading shaft, into an open elevator shaft          that drops into darkness.          The wire tightens and he\\'s swung by the foot back into an          open corridor, two floors below, like a demented base-jumper.          He SLAMS into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open          shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom          exploding on IMPACT.                         CUT TO:          INT.

He stretches for the          gun... too far from his reach.          The flashlight is \"on\", illuminating the area. He pushes off          the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable          to grab it.          The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER          pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve          it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It          drops all the way to the bottom as...                         ANGLE ON          HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see          the flashlight fall from sight...

ANGLE ON/CLOSE UP          BOWER\\'S face fills with blood as he hangs upside down, trying          to catch his breath. His grip is weakening as he looks up to          see... a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand,          leering at him from the shadows, approaching. With no time          to defend himself and no where to go...          SCREECH!          The cable is violently tugged from above, jerking BOWER          upward, pulling him away from the wall. He spins wildly          trying to grab back onto the wall as...          SCREECH!          The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the          ceiling and swing toward the open shaft. His fingers claw at          the wall as he\\'s literally being reeled in like a fish.

ANGLE ON          The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels          above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn          back, fading into the shadows.          BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the          FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand.          BOWER (CONT\\' D )          Please... don\\'t- Please, listen-          The FIGURE slashes BOWER\\'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and          looks at his identification tattoo.          BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the          light with a curious frown.          TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing.          Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full-          framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes.

They stare at one another in silence.          TANAKA hands him a flashlight. BOWER does his best charades,          gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship.

BOWER stops,          I eyeing his numerous bladed weapons.                         I                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          No. Listen, you should stay.

PAYTON is coated with sweat, viciously pounding on the locked          doors with a heavy pipe. It\\'s obviously having no effect and          he collapses with exhaustion and frustration.          !                         PAYTON          GOD DAMMIT!

CONTINUED:          Like a dripping faucet of annoyance, PAYTON bitterly turns          his flashlight quickly towards the corner. Wielding the          heavy pipe, he cautiously approaches.          SCRAPE... RATTLE.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          WHO\\'S THERE!?          SCRAPE... THUMP.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          IDENTIFY YOURSELF!

That can\\'t be... you-          The SOUNDS remain muffled, deeper within the wall, possibly          from inside the ventilation shaft.          PAYTON contemplates, eyes panicked. He climbs up the wall          and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening, jamming it          closed with a screwdriver. He backs away, gripping the          weapon, ready for anything. He tries to control his          breathing as he sits... watches... and waits.          TRAP.          A blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and PAYTON wipes          blood off his nose with confusion and a nervous frown.          DISSOLVE THRU BLACK.          INT. REC ROOM - LATER          A pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel.          Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously          steps through a doorway and into...          A rec room with several rows of pool tables, video games and          a ran-sacked bar. The floor is heavily littered with broken          glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the          bar, tasting it with an eye brow raised.

A FIGURE lunges out, a direct HIT under his jaw sends          him backwards over a table. The FIGURE jumps on top of him,          jabbing a blade toward his neck. He grabs the wrist just as          the tip begins to dig into his throat.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          AAAAARRRRGF! !          A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be          sliced open... CRACK! The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying.          TANAKA has come to his rescue, twirling a pipe across his          palms. The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal... NADIA.          She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly          into TANAKA\\'S chest.                         TANAKA          UUUGH!          She rolls across the floor, grabbing her knife and... BOWER          BLINDS her with his flashlight, raising the gun with a quick          whirl of the energy lever, laser sights flaring brightly.                         BOWER          HOLD IT!          BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face,          smashing against the wall. He raises the gun and...          KA-RAAAACK! A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and          HITS the bar, SHATTERING every piece of glass that\\'s near by          and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Knock it off! Both of ya!          TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find          their weapons on the floor.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here.          Both of you just... cool out. And stop          throwing that shit.          Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Let\\'s all just... go easy here. I          understand it\\'s been every man for          himself around here lately, but if we\\'re          going to get out of this- A little God          damn solidarity wouldn\\'t hurt.

Sighing          with defeat, BOWER gestures, hands raised as he motions for          TANAKA and they slowly back towards the door.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          (motioning to Tanaka)          Thanks... again.          TANAKA motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures          to himself.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Yeah, yeah. I get it. We can work          together on this, right?          TANAKA grins.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          As long as we understand each other.          They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the          shadows with a curious frown.                         CUT TO:          INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER          BOWER and TANAKA head down the corridor, both of them          checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway.          TANAKA is still wincing, rubbing his chest with pain.

She left          me with a few sore spots too, pal.          They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with          pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal          with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them          with a frown.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Listen, lady.

Shadows are moving, growing closer.                         BOWER                         SHIT-          NADIA gestures for them to stay put. TANAKA wants to leave,          but BOWER grabs his shoulder. They both grip weapons,          glancing to NADIA as the HUNTERS seem to be headed their way.

She goes          to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm          F across a scanner.          As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates,          scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of          hydraulics.

A large lab storage compartment that has been          \"lived-in\" for a long time. A bed has been created from          assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of          scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the          belongings of her bag onto the floor.          BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test          tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with          condensation.

NADIR          It\\' seems to be the only living thing left          on this ship worth protecting.          Regardless of the situation, we still          have a mission. We\\'ve only lost about          thirty percent of the specimens, mostly          reptilian class. Never was big into          snakes anyway.          BOWER doesn\\'t share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a          darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted          graph of the new planet, TANIS.                         BOWER          (under his breath)          Tanis.                         NADIA          (off his look)          You couldn\\'t remember?                         BOWER          No, I- I didn\\'t remember just how far          away it is... until now. This was a          hundred and twenty-three year flight.          NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag.          TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination,          tapping the tubes to see movement inside.

And the          training comes back first. For good          reason, I guess.

He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight. The          \"SOUNDS\" are closer then ever before as something is heard          crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft.

GALLO, a          young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair,          heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes.

BOWER          I don\\'t see what he\\'s looking at, do you?                         NADIA          We have to keep moving. We don\\'t want to          stay out in the open for too long.          Especially in here.                         BOWER                         (TO TANAKA)          Hey...? Let\\'s go!          Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they          tighten up with their weapons, eyes scanning. TANAKA refuses          to look away, poised like a hunter.                         NADIA          We can\\'t stay herel          NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him          on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver.                         BOWER          Let\\'s get out of here! Com\\'on-          The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows.          BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade          of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind.                         CUT TO:          INT. PROCESSING DOCK -CONT.          BOWER emerges from the barricades into a processing center          for loading passengers, darkened and in shambles. NADIA is          scanning the corridors ahead, choosing her path as BOWER          rushes to catch her.                         BOWER          We can\\'t just leave him. We have to wait-                         NADIA          Then you wait... and find your own way.

I\\'m          not gonna get myself killed for-                         BOWER          The guy saved my life twice already. I\\'m          not gonna leave him-                         NADIA          What do you think he\\'s doing in there!?                         BOWER          How the hell should I know-                         NADIA          He\\'s hunting! Bagging the next notch on          his belt. You wait for him! Good luck.          I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened          and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration.          Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA.          I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA\\'S pace is          difficult for BOWER to keep up.                         BOWER          Wait! I\\'m coming-          There\\'s a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light,          picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the          light to realize it\\'s... A HUMAN FINGER BONE.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Jesus!          NADIA turns toward him to see...                         REVERSE ANGLE          Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and          carcasses. They\\'ve just crawled into a pit of human remains.          They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of          carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they          begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead          remains.

A          SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS. They freeze, laying on          top of the remains, the bones CRINKLING underneath them.          The HISS grows stronger... and they look up to see a          silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter,          leering in their direction.                         NADIA                         (WHISPER)          Don\\'t move.          They try to remain motionless, but the slope of the remains          i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to          slide. The HISS grows stronger.          They hold their position until... a SHUDDER approaches with          FLICKERING LIGHTS. The power surge is enough to ignite a          small landslide underneath them.                         BOWER                         SHIT-          NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly          to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh.          The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and          BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see...          the HUNTER is gone.                         NADIA                         (WHISPER)          Where... did it go-?          He pans the light and... ROAR! The HUNTER lunges at them          from five feet away. BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to          send him flying, CRASHING into a pile of bones.          NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands... but the          HUNTER is already gone. She spins back and... THWAP! She\\'s          HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the          floor. The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand          grabs her hair... teeth opening towards her neck and...          POW! BOWER charges into the HUNTER, tackling it and they          spin into a brutal and distorted fight, seen under the          FLICKERING LIGHT. Even though the HUNTER is a smaller one,of          the pack, smaller then BOWER, its speed and strength is in-          human. It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and...

TANAKA lunges out of the shadows, delivering a blow          with his bladed pipe into the HUNTER\\'S face. It\\'s a hit that          would normally kill anything, nearly taking its head off.          The HUNTER stumbles, staggers and... HIIIISSSSSST! It HITS          TANAKA, sending him airborne, nearly knocking him out.          Under the FLICKERING LIGHT, BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA all          attack the lone HUNTER, taking all three of them to bring it          to the floor. They viciously pound it with pipes and blades          until it finally stops flinching beneath them.          Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood. The          three of them back away, gasping and coated in its blood.                         BOWER                         (GASPING)          Jesus... Christ- Jesus-          Its face is smashed beyond recognition, but its facial          features are horrifically distorted, no sign of eyes under          the shredded tissue.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          What the... what the hell is it!?          The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright.          NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters          to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them.                         NADIA                         ANOTHER ONE-          BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN slowly          begins to TAP his spear against the wall, echoing a continual          clank through the hull.                         BOWER          What is he... doing?          BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows          begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by          the tapping of metal.                         NADIA          Run.                         BOWER          They\\'re... everywhere-                         NADIA          Run!

CONTINUED: (4)          A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN\\'S throat.          NADIA is already gone. BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as          the walls come to life, HUNTERS swarming onto their path like          a pack of wild dogs.          Before diving through the barricade, BOWER looks back to see          HEFLIN and his pack have paused... to eat the fallen HUNTER.                         CUT TO:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR - CONT.          It\\'s a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl          through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of          sleep chambers. HUNTERS can be heard closing on their trail.          They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep-          chamber, frantically trying to pull the hatch closed. TANAKA          follows suite, jumping inside another chamber and BOWER          scrambles, in search of an open door as footsteps are heard          quickly approaching.          In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA,          tugging the hatch closed.                         FOLLOW THRU:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER - CONT.          BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both          gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror.          Through the porthole... silhouetted HUNTERS move past with          weapons in hand, search and destroy style. One HUNTER steps          up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze,          holding their breath. Slowly the HUNTERS continue past, the          shadows slowly fading from sight.                         BOWER          What the hell happened to them!? What          the hell are those things!?                         NADIA          Shut-up!          They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER          looks at his hand, finger tips trembling.                         CUT TO:                                                                                                              72.          INT. SLEEPING CHAMBER/MAIN CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER          The hatch door inches open and BOWER peeks out. He and NADIA          crawl out quietly to see TANAKA waiting for them.                         TANAKA          Japanese - No subtitles.                         BOWER          I second that. Let\\'s get the fuck out of          here. Which way did we come from?                         NADIA          You want to go back?                         BOWER          No, I mean... let\\'s just go!                         NADIA          We should go back. Find a different          path. I don\\'t think we can get through          to the reactor bay from-                         BOWER          You said there was no other path.                         NADIA          I\\'m ready to explore other options-                         BOWER          Which way did they go-?                         NADIA          You really want to discuss it here!?          A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison.          It\\'s a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the          massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a          nearby sleep-chamber. And then...          BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas          erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the          shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as...          Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls          out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping          for breath, muscles twitching.                         BIG PASSENGER          AA.AAAA.RGH !

CONTINUED:          The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and          heaving, mumbling in Russian. BOWER tries to stand but NADIA          pulls him back.                         NADIA          What are you doing-!?                         BOWER          They\\'ll hear him- They\\'ll- We\\'ve got to                         HELP HIM-          Footsteps thunder across the floor and... WHACK! The BIG          PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN. The          HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the          shadows from every direction, bladed weapons spinning.          BOWER pulls away from NADIA\\'S grip and prepares to intervene,          but TANAKA suddenly grabs him, holding him back with force.          With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor, the          HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion, praying          thanks for the feast the ship has presented.          They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally          attacked and eaten alive. WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under          the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory          dance, a frenzy of pure evil.          This attack is heard more then it is seen, under flickering          lights, obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower          and the groups reactions.          Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA          to the corner where she\\'s lifted a grate in the floor. They          climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as...          The SCREAMS and HISSES echo through the hull.          FADE THRU BLACK:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER          PAYTON is seated at the control desk, scrolling across radio          frequencies, talking softly into the boom mic.          PAYTON (INTO RADIO)          Bower? Do you copy? You out there?          Dead static. He sighs and glances toward GALLO, passed out          on a nearby bunk. He hesitates, holding the pipe as a          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a          closer inspection.

GALLO          What are you doing?                         PAYTON          Just... checking you.          GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter.

GALLO\\'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably.                         PAYTON (CONT\\'D)          .you\\'re okay-          GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket, defensively.                         GALLO          I\\'m fine.          PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the          dried blood still splattered across his legs.                         PAYTON          Is this your blood... Corporal?                         GALLO          Some of it is... sir.                         PAYTON          Whose blood is it?          GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening.                         GALLO          They didn\\'t give me any choice.                         PAYTON          Who didn\\'t?

(off his look)          Of the worst sort. They were- I          couldn\\'t even- I had to defend myself.                         PAYTON          Pandorum. Both of them-?

PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment, popping open a First-Aid          case; inside is a pistol-gripped syringe. He turns back and          GALLO squares off, clenched fists.                         GALLO          What are you doing? What is that?                         PAYTON          It\\'s just a sedative. Help you relax-          GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.                         GALLO          Then you take it... and relax.          PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside.                         PAYTON          Take it easy. We\\'re on the same team          here. Alright?                         GALLO                         (FLATLY)          Sure, Lieutenant.          PAYTON turns back to the control console and continues his          search across the radio frequencies. He discreetly pulls the          pipe weapon closer to his seat.          GALLO holds a hollow stare on the back of his head.

LIGHTS FLICKER past...          FLICKER CUT TO:          INT. SUB-LEVEL SHAFT - LATER          A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal... BOWER crouched inside          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo          lined with octagonal filters.          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.                         BOWER          Didn\\'t we come through here already?                         NADIA          We gotta find a way out.                         BOWER          Out? Why did we come iii-?                         NADIA          I was trying to get us out of there alive-                         BOWER          I thought you knew where you were going.                         NADIA          I was trying to save our asses-                         BOWER          Could\\'ve mentioned that after the first          mile. If I would have known we\\'d be          doing laps down here-          She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand.                         NADIA          I didn\\'t need to help you at all! You          and the Hong-Kong Express would still be          playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if          it weren\\'t for me!

They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and          various food containers. The tank appears empty.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          What is this!?          BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates          with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch...                         FOLLOW THRU:          INT. TANK - CONT.          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.                         LELAND          No, no, no. Back in der\\' big boy!

CONTINUED:          LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKA\\'S hand. He loses his grip          and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank. BOWER pulls          NADIR out of the way of the hatch.                         BOWER          Get back! BACK!          BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises          the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank.          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there\\'s a          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.                         LELAND          Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!?          LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke          from his face, bewildered. He\\'s an older man who\\'s lost all          vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with          assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt.                         LELAND (CONT\\'D)          What did you do!?          BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him.                         BOWER          Shut off the gas!                         LELAND          Where did you get that?          BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the          chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.                         LELAND (CONT\\'D)          NO-NO! HO-HO!                         BOWER          SHUT IT OFF!          LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers          and twists nozzles, shutting off the flow of chemical gas.          His frown transforms to a grin, raising an eye brow as he          stares into the barrel of BOWER\\'S weapon.

LELAND cranks an energy lever that          ignites a string of auxiliary lights around the tank,          widening their view of the unusual living space. Several          crates and an assortment of mechanical junk and supplies.                         LELAND          Com\\'in, com\\'in! Make yerselves at home.

LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the          catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch          him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand.                         BOWER          You... live here?                         LELAND          Sublet.

Three singles or will a queen do?          LELAND laughs to himself, digging through supplies. BOWER          scans the walls, seeing no way up to the catwalks.                         BOWER          Why don\\'t you come on down so we can meet          properly?                         LELAND          Oh, no-no. No-can-do.

LELAND hovers over a make-          shift stove, heating a can of water. He pours in some powder          and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef          preparing fine cuisine.                         LELAND          It\\'s tough to properly season with a          motor oil base. But if you use your          imagination, kinda tastes like...                         (SIP)          Herb and garlic dog shit.          Below the catwalks, TANAKA has found a spot to rest, NADIR is          using water to clean a wound and BOWER is peering through a          slit in a vent.                         BOWER          How long have you been awake?                         LELAND          Mmmm. Lemme think. What\\'s today,          Tuesday? That would be about, mmm...

LELAND (CONT-D)          I quit counting after the band broke up,          ooooh twenty... thirty years ago.          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The          classical music begins to SKIP and without even looking          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.                         LELAND (CONT-D)          Then again, an hour in this place feels          more like... one-fifteen, one-twenty.          Know whatta I mean? HA-HP_W!

What gas!?          They see he\\'s holding a fork and knife that he quickly tucks          behind his back. NP.DIA jabs the weapon and he shrieks.                         LELAND (CONT\\'D)          NEVER!          THE SHUDDER shakes the tank with more force then ever before          as they watch the ceiling. It\\'s followed by two quick          SURGES, higher pitch.

NADIA          What does that mean?                         BOWER          it means we have less time then I          thought. The last phase... before          shutdown. It means we\\'re... done.          BOWER is oddly defeated, taking a seat, hanging his head.                         NADIA          Done!? What do you mean done? What do          we do? Hey!?                         BOWER          What difference does it make?                         NADIA          What are you talking about? You said you          could reset the reactor- That we could-          That there\\'s a chance to-                         BOWER          For what? They\\'re gone. Everything is          gone. There\\'s no Earth to go back to,                         THERE\\'S NO-                         NADIA          We weren\\'t meant to go back! We were          meant to go on.

This flight\\'s over.          NADIA is angered by his defeat, shoving LELAND aside and          squaring off in front of BOWER.                         NADIA          What about your duty? What about... your          wife!? There\\'s still a chance she\\'s-                         BOWER          She\\'s dead.

NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye.                         NADIA          DON\\'T DO THAT! DON\\'T GIVE UP ON ME!          Off her look, BOWER holds his stare, slowly seduced by her          will. They look is broken by... LELAND\\'S stereo system          CRACKLES with static, power slowly returning after the power          surge, music playing.          BOWER snaps out of his daze, turning to LELAND.                         BOWER          You got a radio?

GALLO looks up with a frown.          BOWER (ON RADIO)          Payton? Do you copy? Can you hear me!?          He grabs the receiver.                         PAYTON          BOWER! I\\'m here!

WATER PROCESSOR/CATWALK - CONT.          Our group is now crowded on the catwalk above the tank,          huddled around an assortment of patched together electronic          equipment. BOWER is speaking into a receiver, bound together          with wire while LELAND cranks the power lever.                         BOWER          Storage Tanks, just below B-level.

SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK          PAYTON vigorously cranks the power lever and slides his          finger across the screen of the ship\\'s blueprint.                         I PAYTON           How the hell did you get all the way to          Y the other side of-          I BOWER (ON RADIO)          Payton, listen to me. Listen. The          I reactor is in its final stage. Its last          rotation. It\\'s worse then we thought.          PAYTON looks to GALLO, who is silently watching with a hollow          glare from the corner.          BOWER (ON RADIO) (CONT`D)          The ship is dying and I think that\\'s why          it finally woke us up. The entire system          is heading into permanent shutdown and          there will be no return. This entire          ship will float off into eternity with no          way of stopping it. We need to reset it.          Are you hearing me?          PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare.                         PAYTON          I hear you. How do we get you in there?                         I BOWER          I need you to give me a path.          PAYTON and GALLO\\'S silent stare hangs in the air for a          moment, the tension between them unclear.

LADDER SHAFT/CORRIDOR - LATER          A flashlight beams cut into a shaft. It appears as if the          gang is crawling backwards toward us, until our perspective          realizes they\\'re crawling down a long ladder.          They reach the bottom level where a distant RUMBLE has grown          louder. They follow the sound through a field of debris to a          clear path leading to an open hatchway.          BOWER checks the marker over the door and leads them down the          corridor, preparing to step through and TANAKA grabs him,          pulling him back.                         BOWER          What?          TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He          i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and          through a hole, hidden in the paneling.                         TANAKA          (Japanese - No Subtitles)                         LELAND          What did he say?                         BOWER          I dunno. But do what he says.          They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into...                         CUT TO:          INT. LOADING PLATFORM          As they head across a loading dock, the room gradually grows          more disturbed and dishevelled. Battle scars and centuries          of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross.          The BLUE GLOW of light can be seen through the passageway and          a low RUMBLE grows louder as they approach. They crouch          behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath.          I BOWER glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown          and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd-colored          algae. He looks up to see it\\'s grown all the way to...          Be freezes to see a small shadowed FIGURE in the rafters          above them, a smaller gargoyle-type silhouette, possibly some          type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay.

The FIGURE begins          to move across the rafter as TANAKA flushes it out.          The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor,          BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps...          A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER.          BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of          the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with          hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.          NADIR lowers her weapon.                         NADIA                         (DEVASTATED)          Oh... my... God...          The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a          i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to          reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of          I skin. Everyone is too stunned to react except for TANAKA,           who instantly raises his weapon, preparing to kill it.                          NADIA (CONT-D)           stop it! STOP IT! Are you crazy? It\\'s           just a child!                         BOWER          Child! ? That\\'s no child! What the hell          is it!?          TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER          erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before          turning and leaping back up and over the rafters,          disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless.                         LELAND          Not as cute when they\\'re little, are          they?          TANAKA runs after it.

They\\'re... breeding.                         BOWER          What!? What do you mean they? How could          they- That\\'s impossible.          It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW          of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the          sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching.

BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement.          His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to, the          label reads; M. PAYTON.

Once that          thing shuts down, we\\'re as good as dead.          Nothing on this ship will ever turn on          again. Ever. Not the air, not the          lights, the heat... not even the pod\\'s          escape launch systems.

GALLO          We can still launch ourselves in the          pods. Before the ignition systems are          completely dead, sir.

You know          that as well as I do-                         PAYTON          I said stand down, Corporal! That\\'s an          order!          GALLO steps up behind PAYTON, his face revealed with a thin          stream of blood oozing from under his nose, dripping off his          chin, eyes hollow and pale. PAYTON refuses to look at him,          continuing to type.                         CUT TO:          INT. LOADING PLATFORM - CONT.

BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly          towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is          felt.

LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous          descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging          onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored          algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming          into view from below.          With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing          his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white          shapes near the bottom.          Squinting into the darkness, he\\'s unable to make out what          he\\'s looking at and he manages to crawl down further,          reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor.

The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past          BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and          illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor          as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white          bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of          the living dead.                         BOWER                         CHRIST ALMIGHTY-          The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly          spring to its feet, lifting its nose towards the air like a          guard dog checking the scent.          BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs          twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS.

Together          they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the          control panel switches and... nothing.

REACTOR CONTROL TERMINAL          BOWER cranks the hand lever faster and faster, the MOAN of          magnetos growing louder and louder. He gives one last spin          and hits the primer switch. A split-second of nothing and          then the panels brightly come to life. The digital panel          reads: >> ROTATION SEQUENCE >> CODE INITIATE TO PROCEED >>          BOWER takes a sigh of relief and glances to see NADIA is          frozen with fright. He follows their eye-line to see the          entire floor of HUNTERS are awake, heads turned towards them.          HEFLIN steps closer in their direction with a HISS.          BOWER gasps and the entire pack of HUNTERS moves toward them          and... suddenly, TANAKA bangs his bladed weapon against the          railing with a heavy CLANK! The HUNTERS instantly turn          toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon, HITTING          one of the HUNTERS directly in the head.          TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a          hatch, coated with vines and vegetation. HEFLIN screeches a          command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction, grabbing          their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs.          They climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the          hatch, following TANAKA.                         NADIA          Hurry! Go!          BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and          continuing the process as the reactor begins to HUM as...                         CUT TO:          INT. LOADING PLATFORM          TANAKA is running at full sprint, bounding over dishevelled          equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged          HUNTERS emerge from every direction to follow his path.          One HUNTER gains quickly at a sprinter\\'s pace and TANAKA runs          directly for the open hatchway. (The hatchway they detoured          earlier.) He dives through as the sprinting HUNTER is almost          upon him.          A booby-trap is sprung, hydraulic pistons SNAP a razor-wire          that \"clotheslines\" the HUNTER, nearly ripping him in half as          TANAKA hits the floor, rolls to his feet and keeps running.          HEFLIN and the HUNTERS slash the tangled snare with their          weapons, trying to break through.

BOWER types quickly, flipping numerous switches and... a          SHUDDER is felt, the tower begins to TREMBLE with a low bass          MOAN, like an engine trying to turn over.                         BOWER          Com\\'on...          NADIA looks back to see there are still HUNTERS in the          reactor bay, ones who didn\\'t join the chase, slowly coming          out of the shadows, crawling up the walls.

He turns          to see... WEASEL and numerous HUNTERS have them surrounded,          waiting to pounce. With nowhere to go, they are done for as          WEASEL CACKLES a command, the HUNTERS moving in, just as...          SHIIIISSSSH! High pressure steam erupts from the reactor\\'s          pressure relief valves. The HUNTERS back pedal in fear as          the ventilation system ignites... fresh oxygen hits the blue          torches... BURSTING into BRILLIANT ORANGE FIREBALLS..          The HUNTER\\'S scatter in a panic as the BRIGHT FLAMES are          blinding and a tremendous SHUDDER travels through the ship          like an earthquake...          MATCH CUT TO:          INT.

The SHUDDER hits the control desk, rattling the monitors and          1 WARNING LIGHTS and BUZZERS ignite as the ship feels full          power after centuries of laying dormant.          I GALLO slows his POUNDING, blood coating his fists.                         PAYTON          I My God... he did it! He did it.

GALLO (CONTT\\' D )          What are you going to tell them? Huh?          How are you going to explain that?                         PAYTON          shut-up.

REACTOR BAY - CONT.          Other HUNTERS have retreated away from the reactor, cowering          in fear with the exception of WEASEL, enraged by the temple\\'s          disturbance. He HISSES as he lunges for BOWER. Trying to          duck, they SLAM into the reactor wall and CRASH to the          catwalk below.

The fire quickly spreads across WEASEL\\'S          skin, igniting the oil that\\'s been rubbed across his body.          With WEASEL SCREECHING wildly and engulfed in flame, BOWER          viciously continues pummeling him, throwing a rage of blows          until the body stops twitching. The flames begin to catch on          BOWER\\'S arms and NADIA pulls him back.          They look to see most of the HUNTERS fleeing the room, but          others have grabbed weapons. BOWER grabs her arm, pulling          her towards the hatch.                         CUT TO:          INT. LOADING DOCK - CONT.

HEFLIN waiting for him.          They stare one another down, both raising their bladed          weapons as LIGHTS shatter and implode around them from their          own intensity.

The haggard          and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the          middle of CHAOS. Before he can get a breath he\\'s attacked by          HUNTERS.          What was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal, is now a          disco tech from hell as lights FLASH across the corridor in          what appears to be a massive riot, PASSENGERS and HUNTERS          fighting.

TANAKA screams, hitting          HEFLIN\\'S head with everything he\\'s got, but he won\\'t let go.          TANAKA lifts HEFLIN\\'S feet and ROARS as he charges himself          directly into the wall, neck bones SNAPPING! HEFLIN goes          limp, dropping to the floor dead as TANAKA gasps... looking          down to see the damage has been done, blood flowing heavily.          He takes a breath, turns to exit FREEZING to see... the CHILD          HUNTER standing alone, sensing the death of HEFLIN with          almost an expression of sorrow. TANAKA lowers his weapon          and... THWACK! The CHILD stabs TANAKA in the chest with a          small bladed weapon.

With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint          towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side          corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive          through the sliding doors...          One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with          a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER          spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back          pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing          weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with          SCREECHES and HISSES of rage.

CONTINUED: ( 3)          BOWER and NADIA back further away, turning to see the room.          The original room that BOWER woke up in now looks quite          different with all the systems engaged, BLINDING LIGHT coming          from the monitors and computer terminals.          They move through the room, passing the empty sleep chambers          and the control console, seeing the entire pathway of dripped          blood across the floor.                         NADIA          Where\\'s... your lieutenant?                         BOWER          He\\'s not my lieutenant.          She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the          floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead.          BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading          towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind.                         FOLLOW THRU:          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE - CONT.          A tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge.          A stunning sight, a split-level glass control deck, rows of          blinking control panels and flight chairs. It appears          undisturbed, a thin layer of silt floats out from under their          footsteps.          BOWER leads the way, panning the weapon throughout the room          with no sign of GALLO. On the far wall; cockpit windows          coated with a black fungus that obscures the view, but hints          to the illusion of outer space, a haze of cosmic dust without          stars.                         NADIA                         (IN AWE)          What\\'s happened... to us? Where are we?          BOWER goes to the nearest control console, tapping the          keyboard. The computer instantly responds, data scrolling          across the screen.                         BOWER          Flight log. It\\'ll tell us how long we\\'ve          I been out... and how far we\\'ve gone.          BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll          through the flight computer\\'s time-code. Starting with the          launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and          faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.

CONTINUED:          NADIA walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with          fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a          FIGURE sitting in it. GALLO, motionless and gazing toward          the windows.          Off her gasp, BOWER grabs his gun and approaches as the          computer time-code continues to roll even faster with no sign          of slowing... months becoming years.          BOWER approaches from behind GALLO... his identification          tatto now clearly visible... FLT>>004>>012>>. He cranks the          lever on the gun with a WHINE of magnetos and the laser          sights flare brightly onto GALLO\\'S back.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          Seems my little memory lapse has finally          worn off... \"Lieutenant\".          BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the          stream of blood from GALLO\\'S ear shown running down his neck.                         GALLO                         (DRYLY)          Mine too.                         BOWER          Who the hell are you?          GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          You\\'re team four. Why would you...          switch bunks? Pretend to be someone          else? What would you be wanting to hide?          Who the hell are you?                         GALLO          I was younger then you when I first came          on board. Funny, I can\\'t even remember          what it was like... before this flight          began. It\\'s all I know.                         BOWER          You were the one... who first received          the final transmission. Who refused to          go back to sleep. You stayed awake...          for all those years. What were you          doing... what crimes were you hiding from          when you took Payton\\'s bunk?          The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into          decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.

What have you done to us?          Where are we now?          GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.                         GALLO          Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me.          BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He          stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the          front control console, towards the glass.          With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a          quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer.          GALLO (CONT \\' D )          What are. you gonna do, Bower? There\\'s no          one left to hand out merit badges. No          one left at all.                         BOWER          And that makes it okay? To play God?                         GALLO          You think God survived? He\\'s gone...          with the rest. There\\'s no one left to          judge you, Bower.          NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily          smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of          sludge.                         BOWER          Judgement will come for you. You think          you could cover it? Your victims          survived. Evolved. That\\'s your creation          out there. Your crime.          BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          And you thought you\\'d be able to hide it?          Who would ever suspect that? Who would          ever remember? I remember.          NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the          darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades into          centuries...

With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly          cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised-          A slow grin spreads across GALLO\\'S face as he finally looks          to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have          dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck.          GALLO (CONT`D)          Try to imagine it. Imagine... yourself          for five minutes without morality.

I offer you the kingdom and you-                         BOWER                         SHUT-UP-                         GALLO          There\\'s still quite a few sleeping          beauties down there... a thousand          flavors.

GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.                         GALLO          A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo?                         BOWER          HEAR ME ASSHOLE?!          NADIA suddenly GASPS... flinching away from the cockpit          windows, having just seen what\\'s outside. Her expression is          ghostly as she back pedals.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          What is it?          GALLO looks up with a blood-soaked grin.                         BOWER (CONT\\'D)          What do you see!?

NADIA          has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans          toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and...          SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He          leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart          past. The shin is underwater.          BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to          chuckle.                         BOWER                         (DISBELIEF)          We\\'ve... we\\'ve already crashed.

Just doesn\\'t float too well.          BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one,          quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the          console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER\\'S throat.          BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun          away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade.          G_ALLO (CONT\\'D)          And you thought you could be King!?          He slides the blade under BOWER\\'S neck and... there\\'s a WHIRL          of magnetos.          He looks up to see NADIA cranking the lever on the energy          gun. She tries to turn the gun towards him and...                         I          GALLO lunges toward her just as she\\'s able to FIRE! The          BLA..ST of energy goes into the console with a CRACK of          1 THUNDER, knocking everyone off their feet. Shattered glass          and metal HIT the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel...                         CLOSE UP          .sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass.

Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room          like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown          across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast          of black water, sent tumbling.

BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open          hatch, pulling her with.                         NADIA          NO!? Are you crazy-                         BOWER          GET IN!          He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits          the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>>          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.

The          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the          lights, taking them into BLACK.          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper          corner... only a foot of air remaining.

He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only          several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps          desperately into the corner.          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath          and the water rises over his head.          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.

A gentle          breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering          across the surface of an ocean.          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to          consciousness.                         BOWER          Hey...? Hey?          She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself,          looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright          sunlight.                         NADIA                         (GASPING)          Where are we? What happened?                         BOWER                         (GRIN)          It\\'s all right. It\\'s safe to wake up          this time.                         I          With eyes of disbelief, they turn to see...                         WIDE ANGLE          They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs          within the ocean waves. They\\'re just off shore from a          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and          their geography are nothing like we\\'ve ever seen on Earth.          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a          brilliant glow on the horizon.          FADE TO BLACK:          INT. COMMAND DECK          Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as          unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump          motors whine down and shut off as...

CONTINUED:          standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER\\'S          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,          deeply contemplating.          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A          kingdom, for the taking.          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean          uniform.                         YOUNG GALLO          Well, if you\\'re gonna be captain... what          are we gonna do now?          Off his look...                         CUT TO:          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER          SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber          compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep-          chambers are lined against the wall.          GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN\\'S uniform, he          straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods,          typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the          wedding ring (PAYTON\\'S ring) he\\'d forgotten he\\'s still          wearing.                         GALLO          What is a King... without his Queen.          He hits the control panel switch and...          INT.
